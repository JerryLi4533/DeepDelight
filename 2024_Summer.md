## Thread 2 (Lixiao and Mengyang)

### 2024 Summer Objectives

* [ ] 1. Wrap up RAG implementation on NewsQA and QAConv
* [ ] 2. New focus on the retrieval stage with dense vectors
      * [ ] Consider Robust 04 (HARD track): https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/robust04
      * [ ] Other IR benchmark datasets (e.g. HotpotQA, TREC-Covid) at: 
            * [ ] https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/beir, 
            * [ ] https://paperswithcode.com/paper/beir-a-heterogenous-benchmark-for-zero-shot
      * [ ] BEIR code: https://github.com/beir-cellar/beir
      * [ ] Results: 
            * [ ] https://github.com/beir-cellar/beir
            * [ ] https://eval.ai/web/challenges/challenge-page/1897/leaderboard/4475
      * [ ] Retrieval (scoring) functions to consider
            * [ ] Benchmark: dot, cosine, TF*IDF, BM25
            * [ ] New methods: DLITE, BM25-revision, Portfolio (diversity)

High Commissioner for Refugees said on Monday that more than 12,000 people have fled militia attacks over the last few days from Sudan's Darfur region to neighboring Chad, still recovering from a recent attempt by rebels there to topple the government.\n\n\n\n\"Most of the new arrivals in Chad had already been displaced in Darfur in recent years. They are really tired of being attacked and having to move,\" said UNHCR's Jorge Holly. \"All the new refugees we talked to said they did not want to go back to Darfur at this point, they wanted to be transferred to a refugee camp in eastern Chad.\"\n\n\n\nThis latest influx of refugees in Chad aggravates an already deteriorating security situation across this politically unstable region of Africa.\n\n\n\nBefore the latest flight into Chad, the UNHCR and its partner groups \"were taking care of 240,000 Sudanese refugees in 12 camps in eastern Chad and some 50,000 from Central African Republic in the south of the country.\" Up to 30,000 people in Chad fled the country for Cameroon during the rebel-government fighting.\n\n\n\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross said on Monday that one of its employees was killed in western Darfur last week during fighting. The victim is a 45-year-old Sudanese national and father of six children.\n\n\n\nHe was killed in the area of Seleia, one of the three towns where reported government-backed Janjaweed militia attacks on Friday left around 200 people dead.\n\n\n\nU.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon last week deplored the acts, urged all parties to stop hostilities, and said \"all parties must adhere to international humanitarian law, which prohibits military attacks against civilians.\"\n\n\n\nThe United Nations says \"more than 200,000 people have been killed and 2.2 million others forced to flee their homes since fighting began in 2003 among government forces, rebel groups and allied militia groups known as the Janjaweed.\"\n\n\n\nThe recent fight between Chad's government and rebels is seen as a proxy war over Darfur. Sudan's government believes Chad is supporting rebels in Darfur. Chad's government believes Sudan is supporting the rebels that moved on Chad's capital of N'Djamena.

I really can't believe this,\" Tutu said. \"You have to wake me up and tell me this is actually happening here.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Dalai Lama scrapped his planned trip to South Africa this week after the nation failed to issue him a visa in time, his spokesman said.\n\n\n\n\n\nVisa applications for him and his entourage were submitted to the South African High Commission in New Delhi, India, at the end of August, and original passports were submitted on September 20, more than two weeks ago, a statement on his website said.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, South Africa's foreign affairs office said it did not refuse a visa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"South Africa will not comment on the decision, because it is not our decision, it is his decision,\" according to spokesman Clayson Monyela, who said the visa application was still under consideration.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Dalai Lama had been invited to the country to receive the Mahatma Gandhi International Award for Peace and Reconciliation and to speak at a number of events, including a lecture in honor of Tutu's 80th birthday. Tutu and the Dalai Lama are recipients of the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\n\n\n\n\nTutu said he would pray for the defeat of South Africa's government, led by the African National Congress (ANC), which is rooted in the fight against the system of apartheid, or legal racial separation, that was present in South Africa until 1994.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You are disgraceful,\" Tutu said about the government. \"You are behaving in a way that is totally at variance with the things for which we stood.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ANC plans to call on government officials to explain to South Africans why the visa process was delayed, spokesman Jackson Mtembu said. He said everyone was in the dark about this matter.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut he also suggested that Tutu calm down. A comparison to apartheid regimes, he said, was unfair.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is not the first time the Dalai Lama has not been able to visit South Africa. In 2009, South Africa refused the Tibetan spiritual leader a visa to attend an international peace conference, saying it was not in the country's interest for him to attend.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn refusing the 2009 application, South Africa said that if the Dalai Lama attended the conference, the focus would shift away from the 2010 World Cup, the global soccer championship it was hosting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We cannot allow focus to shift to China and Tibet,\" presidential spokesman Thabo Masebe said, adding that South Africa had gained much from its trading relationship with China.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Dalai Lama fled Tibet in 1959 after a failed uprising against Chinese rule, and China pressures governments around the world to deny him any legitimacy.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeculation surfaced Tuesday that this year's visit was also affected by South Africa's relationship with China.\n\n\n\n\n\nSouth African Vice President Kgalema Motlanthe visited Beijing last week and met with Chinese President Hu Jintao to discuss bolstering bilateral ties.\n\n\n\n\n\nMotlanthe said South Africa was ready to boost the strategic partnership between the two countries to a new stage, according to the official Chinese news agency Xinhua.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Monyela said the application had nothing to do with China.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We are a sovereign nation which takes decisions in our domestic interest,\" Monyela said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Dalai Lama posted a message on Twitter last week that said: \"Even if the Chinese leave nothing but ashes, Tibet will rise from these ashes as a free country even if it takes a long time to do so.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nKim Norgaard, CNN's Johannesburg bureau chief, contributed to this

 -- England international footballer Steven Gerrard was found not guilty of affray by a court in his home city on Friday.\n\n\n\nEngland international Steven Gerrard was cleared by a court in Liverpool of affray.\n\n\n\nThe jury at Liverpool Crown Court took a little over an hour to clear Gerrard of charges relating to a fracas in a nightclub bar in the north-western of England city on December 29 of last year.\n\n\n\nThey accepted the Liverpool captain's version that he acted in self defense in punching businessman Marcus McGhee.\n\n\n\nThe 29-year-old was the only one of the seven defendants in the case to be cleared after an incident which was described by judge Henry Globe as an \"explosion of violence.\"\n\n\n\nGerrard spoke of his relief outside the court.\n\n\n\n\"Can I just say how pleased I am with today's verdict,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\"I'm glad to put this case behind me and I am really looking forward to the season ahead and concentrating on my football now.\n\n\n\n\"I would just like to say a big thank you to my legal team and to my friends and family and everyone at Liverpool football club for supporting me.\"\n\n\n\nHis comments were met with a round of applause from a large group of fans of the Premier League club who had gathered outside the court, before he was ushered away.\n\n\n\nGerrard was celebrating in the Lounge Inn in Southport, a suburb of Liverpool, after scoring twice his team's 5-1 win at Newcastle which took them to the top of the Premier League.\n\n\n\nVideo footage, which was available to the court, showed the moment around 2.am in the morning when trouble flared.\n\n\n\nGerrard apparently wanted to change the music on the CD player and the 34-year-old McGee said the football star had acted aggressively in trying to grab the device.\n\n\n\nIn the fracas which followed, Gerrard admitted throwing three punches but said only one connected.\n\n\n\nHe claimed, and his version was accepted by the jury, that he believed he was about to be attacked himself.\n\n\n\n\"You did not start the violence, it was started by the violent elbowing of Marcus McGee in the face by one of your friends, John Doran,\" Globe said.\n\n\n\n\"The victim's consequential actions of reeling backwards and then forwards and your actions in response to that movement forward has to be seen against that background,\" he

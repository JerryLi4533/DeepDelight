       "'And one senator, for example today, Senator Bob Casey, a Democrat from Pennsylvania, sent a letter to the president urging him - I\\'m quoting from the letter - he says, \"to put an end to these practices immediately, to ensure that the investment decisions being made by Freddie Mac are in line with the intent of Congress and the greater needs of our economy.\" So we also spoke today with Senator Johnny Isakson, a Republican from Georgia, who\\'s also interested in reforming Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. So I think there are people on Capitol Hill who are starting to really ponder, What is the structure of these organizations and what role do they play? What\\'s appropriate for them to do? And this is just sort of an interesting look at conflicts of interest. We are not, in any way - our story has not said that it is illegal, just that it raises questions about how it functions.Well, you did quote Alan Boyce in your story, a former bond trader who\\'s been involved in efforts to push for more refinancing of home loans. Freddie Mac, he said, prevented households from being able to take advantage of today\\'s mortgage rates and then bet on it. You say, well, Freddie Mac has two arms, one, the left hand, did not necessarily know what the right hand is doing. However, they seemed to be miraculously working in concert.And there are people in Congress now who are starting to wonder about whether or not this should be changed, at the moment, as the laws are structured, and as Freddie Mac\\'s mission is, which is to not go broke. You know, it\\'s supposed to be a solvent organization doing its business, but it\\'s also supposed to be helping homeowners. This structure could be called into question.'"

Under the Ninth Circuit's decision, public employees engaged in such work have at least a presumptive first amendment right to perform their jobs as they see fit. That conclusion rests on a fundamentally mistaken view of the first amendment. When the Government pays for somebody to do its work, it has an absolute right to control and direct the manner in which that work is performed. That is a basic rule of agency law, and insofar as Federal employees are concerned, it's a basic rule of our constitutional structure. Article II of the Constitution gives the President the power and responsibility to take care that the laws be faithfully executed. Effectuation of that power, and effectuation of the principle of accountability that it embodies, requires that supervisors in the executive branch be able to control and direct the work of their subordinates. The first amendment, which was adopted just a few years after the Constitution, was not meant to interpose the first amendment in that relationship between supervisor and subordinate or otherwise to regulate the internal affairs of the executive branch. That is the function of civil service laws adopted by the legislature and internal executive branch directives taking into account the relative costs and benefits of certain types of regulation.

Tomorrow he is going to celebrate a mass in a large stadium. There are about 135,000 people who are expected, and some people here are already describing it as the biggest public display of Christian worship in the Islamic heartland because, although the UAE prides itself to be a haven of tolerance, Islam is the official religion, and freedom of worship in other religions have many - there's a lot of restrictions.Francis may challenge his host to grant full religious freedom and also better protection for noncitizens. This is a country that's also been sharply criticized for its human rights record. Keep in mind that out of a population of 9 million, only 1 million are Emiratis. The rest are all foreigners working in this oil-rich federation.Well, let me raise another awkward issue if I can, Sylvia. Many people have paid attention to the war in Yemen, sometimes called the biggest humanitarian crisis in the world. There's a Saudi-led intervention there.

The produced s-expression is then treated the same way as a program you wrote yourself.But after the reader finishes, then the macroexpander gets to transform the program, and it enforces hygiene.I think this is, in some respects, a flaw in the way Racket’s language stack works. But it basically means you want to do as much in the expander as you can, and as little in the reader.okay this all makes sense againit's hard to come back to thinking about this after time away!It seems the reason of scrolling problems is that the os deliver wheel events much more quick than DrRacket's redrawing.

What the Federal Circuit is talking about now is an inquiry into motivation, not skill. Those two are very different concepts. There is not a word in this Court\\'s precedents that says that whether a patent should be granted or not depends on whether a hypothetical person had hypothetical motivation to do what everybody knows he could do.Of course, the reason that the Federal Circuit has devised this additional test or gloss on Graham is that they say obviousness is, it\\'s deceptive in hindsight. In hindsight everybody says, I could have thought of that; and that you need -- if you don\\'t have the sort of constraint that their test imposes, it\\'s going to be too easy to say that everything was obvious.Well, the Court, Mr. Chief Justice, the Court needs to be very clear what is meant by the term \"hindsight.\" If by hindsight is meant looking at what\\'s claimed now, the subject matter sought to be patented, and comparing that to the prior art, to call that analytical process improper hindsight is to make a frontal assault on the statute itself. If by hindsight means to posit a desired result, a clay doorknob, and to ask whether more skill and ingenuity than were required by ordinary skill in the art was needed to do that, to say that that constitutes improper hindsight is to make a frontal assault on the entire body of this Court\\'s precedents construing section 103 and its common law predecessors. With regard to the kind of bias Your Honor is talking about, this Court\\'s precedents provide a wealth of mechanisms for protecting against that, including the statement towards the end of the Graham opinion, which is the only source of the word \"hindsight\" that I\\'ve seen cited in the amici brief, which was a discussion of the secondary consideration. So that in a case like Goodyear against Rayovac there\\'s an excellent case where the claimed subject matter seems so simple in hindsight. This was a case decided by this Court in 1944. A leakproof battery that had been a problem that had defied solution for years and there was all kinds of motivation to solve it, and the fact that it was not solved was considered important by this Court in sustaining the validity of the patent in that case, which claimed nothing more than a sheet metal sheath wrapped around the electrodes and materials generated in the battery.'}\n",

But it could be that she is quoting, as you'll see in the transcript, California law that had talked about jury balances. It's good to have young and old. It's good to have different races. I agree. You're absolutely right. J.E.B. v. Alabama had occurred a couple of years before, and the judge does say, I don't see, Ms. Satriano, that you are seeking to justify excusing people of one ethnicity based on gender. So he seemed to at least be saying, you started with youth. Everything you said about youth, ties in the community, tolerance for drug use, unmarried, which might be distinctions with other young people -- those -- do you have anything else to say? And I -- I suspect she felt like compelled to come up with some further explanation.What -- what is the -- where -- where is the place in what the judge -- when did this eye-rolling take place? I can't figure it out.Okay. Yes. During the judicial voir dire.Yes, I have that in front of me.And --What was the statement that the judge made in respect to which the juror is supposed to have rolled her eyes?The district attorney simply says with one of the questions to which you -- the prospective --Which question?It's unclear.So the reason I can't find it out is none of us know.No, you're right. I mean, it's one where -- it doesn't say in the record eye-rolling.And it actually says it wasn't a question. It was a statement, and that's why I can't figure it out.It -- it seems to be where the juror said yes in response to the voir dire, and then --Which was a question you said ---- turned aside. All we know is yes was said. We don't know what the question was.I see.The -- a point I guess to be made about this confusing transcript -- and of course, I don't know what the file looked like with respect to Miller-El, but this is it. Obviously, there's not a lot to go on, and I think it suggests how vital it is to rely on the trial court judge to make some credibility determination. He's there and sees the district attorney and tries to, after making appropriate inquiries, say that he accepts her non-racial reasons. Counsel for respondent does a lot to compare to Miller-El and so perhaps it's worth just distinguishing briefly. There we have 10 of 11 African American jurors struck. We have the lawyers doing the questioning, trick questions, loaded questions, complicated questions. We have the external evidence of the Dallas manual recommending discriminatory strikes. We have the cards with race written on them. Here, we have a very brief, quick proceeding. The judge is asking the questions and really resisting lawyers' attempts to add to that, to get more information so you can make a valid assessment of the juror that's before you. And so in this instance, obviously, relying on intuition, trial experience, she exercises the two peremptory challenges, one of which was withdrawn on appeal and not pursued, the other with respect to the young person, the demeanor, and youthfulness are the grounds given.\"}\n",

I think the confusion is the use of the term \"aggravated murder,\" which would be not quite correct under Kansas law. There is a statutory requirement of a finding of guilt of capital murder, and that is in very narrow circumstances. Kansas has one of the most narrow death penalties in the Nation. Then once that guilt is determined, we then move to the phase where the State must prove an aggravating factor in addition to having proved that the defendant is guilty of capital murder. Once that is achieved, then the jurors are instructed to give way to a consideration to all aggravating factors that they find, with unanimity, to exist, and to consider all mitigating evidence which they find, individually, to exist, with the only burden on the defendant being relevancy for introduction. And then, they are instructed to consider whether the State has proven, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the mitigating factors do not outweigh the aggravating factors. And, Mr. Chief Justice, if it may please the Court, I\\'d like to reserve the remainder of my time.Thank you, General Kline. Ms. Woodman.Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, Since the argument of the attorney general was addressed exclusively to the question of the constitutionality of the Kansas statute, I will devote all of my argument to that subject, as well, although I am sure that the Court, in deliberations, will be considering the several jurisdictional issues which were briefed and argued earlier in the term. And if there are no questions on those jurisdictional issues, I will proceed to the merits. To pick up on some of the things that were said during Attorney General Kline\\'s argument, the Eighth Amendment requires reliability in the determination that death is an appropriate sentence. And at the selection stage, the question is whether the jury has made a reliable, collective, responsible decision based upon the unique circumstances of the individual defendant that death is an appropriate sentence and that this defendant is particularly culpable in a way that distinguishes him from the mass of death-eligible defendants. And the problem with the equipoise provision here, which the State agrees can occur under the Kansas statute, is that we don\\'t know from a death verdict pronounced by a jury in Kansas whether the jury did decree death by equipoise or not.

You can tell it to \"tag\" some nodes, ask it if some nodes have been tagged, ask if a node could be tagged with a certain (not yet created) tag, etc. There are some other things, too, involving a spreading-activation network and a network by which nodes support the continued existence of other nodes.So, tagswhat’s a `tag?` value?Each node has a bunch of attributes, just an arbitrary hash table.

But Ferrari says as much as Norwegian might want to call OFAC and say come on, we're losing money here...I mean, it's inherent in sanctioning that somebody is going to lose money.It's kind of the point.Right.Instead, he recommends that Norwegian Air put their plea in terms of foreign policy or national security interests, something a little more like, dear OFAC, if you don't grant us this exemption, this plane will stay in Iran. And if that happens...You don't have any control over what might happen to that plane if it will get confiscated or seized by the government.Which would mean that Iran would get a brand-new fancy plane, which the sanctions were created in part specifically to prevent. Obviously, the point of sanctions is not to disincentivize pilots from making safe emergency landings or to keep a $100 million airplane stuck on a tarmac. But that's the thing about these sanctions. They cast a very wide net. They don't just punish Iran. They're meant to cut off Iran from the rest of the world, which they do in part by penalizing anyone from anywhere who tries to do business with Iran.And that is how the United States got in the middle of Norwegian Air's business and Dario's vacation.

       "'And one senator, for example today, Senator Bob Casey, a Democrat from Pennsylvania, sent a letter to the president urging him - I\\'m quoting from the letter - he says, \"to put an end to these practices immediately, to ensure that the investment decisions being made by Freddie Mac are in line with the intent of Congress and the greater needs of our economy.\" So we also spoke today with Senator Johnny Isakson, a Republican from Georgia, who\\'s also interested in reforming Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. So I think there are people on Capitol Hill who are starting to really ponder, What is the structure of these organizations and what role do they play? What\\'s appropriate for them to do? And this is just sort of an interesting look at conflicts of interest. We are not, in any way - our story has not said that it is illegal, just that it raises questions about how it functions.Well, you did quote Alan Boyce in your story, a former bond trader who\\'s been involved in efforts to push for more refinancing of home loans. Freddie Mac, he said, prevented households from being able to take advantage of today\\'s mortgage rates and then bet on it. You say, well, Freddie Mac has two arms, one, the left hand, did not necessarily know what the right hand is doing. However, they seemed to be miraculously working in concert.And there are people in Congress now who are starting to wonder about whether or not this should be changed, at the moment, as the laws are structured, and as Freddie Mac\\'s mission is, which is to not go broke. You know, it\\'s supposed to be a solvent organization doing its business, but it\\'s also supposed to be helping homeowners. This structure could be called into question.'"

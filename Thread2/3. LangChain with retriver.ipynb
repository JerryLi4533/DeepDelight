    "Based on the FIFA Wikipedia website result, I have the following findings:\n",
    "1. When dealing with pure text data, the answer is mostly correct.\n",
    "2. When the answer of the data involves with other format (table, etc.), the result is not displaying (ERROR: The prompt size exceeds the context window size and cannot be processed.)\n",

    "**[10/03 Update] DirectoryLoader Update**\n",

    "Based on the previous results, the loader is changed to the directory loader which contains all different sections in sepetate files, the table content is redescribed using natural language.\n",

    "1. The accuracy has shown some improvement from the previous version, especially for the data that are previously in tabular format. But still does not guarantee the 100% correctness.\n",
    "2. If the question is not specific enough, the model may locate the answer to different files/sections which can lead to incorrect answers.\n",
    "3. Model seems to be able to understand some hierachical relationship between sentenses. (Question6 did not mention \"runners-up\" in the original sentense, but the model seems to understand what it refers to based on the previous and following sentences.)\n",

    "**[10/12 Update] Retriver and Input Update**\n",

    "- Increased the overlap during spilting\n",
    "- Improved retrieval information, now with specific sentences instead of the whole document\n",
    "- Increased the number of documents, added some additional related information to the question as background.\n",

    "Findings:\n",
    "1. Significant improve in correctness, with most of the answers correctly located. \n",
    "2. Can extract information from different paragraphs and do basic counting.\n",
    "3. Basic arithmetic ability is not demonstrated.\n",
    "4. Unable to answer complex/general questions.\n",
    "5. Possibility to understand new concepts given additional background information. But unlikely to understand new concepts without any help.\n",

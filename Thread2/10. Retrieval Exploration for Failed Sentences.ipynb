    "# Retrieval Exploration for Failed Sentences\n",

    "This notebook is updated based on `9.1 .ipynb`, for loop running for large dataset, refer to the `NewsQA Loop - v2.ipunb`. This notebook adds new explorations in prompt engineering for HuggingFace `InstructEmbedding` (`sentence-transformers/multi-qa-MiniLM-L6-cos-v1`) and locally deployed GPT4ALL `gpt4all-falcon-q4_0` model for semantic search and local data training, this notebook also included the retrieval texts from the model aims at differentiating the previous work is caused by **retrival problem** or **instruction problem**. Three additional prompt methods are examined to compare the effect of prompt engineering in question answering. The output is only demonstrating the first story's results.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Updates\n",
    "1. Make the MiniLM embedding returns the top 3 sentences retrieved for anwering.\n",
    "2. Modify the data into the incorrect answered questions from previous results.\n",
    "3. Unable to run WizardLM model locally due to memory limitations, consider adding more GPU to the JupyterHub. (DELAYED)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Findings\n",
    "1. The MiniLM model still can not get the correct sentence from top 3 scored retrieved sentences.\n",
    "2. No obvious improvement for the two failed questions for GPT4ALL model with combination of different chunk sizes and overlap percentages. Same sentences are retrieved for all prompt-modified results.\n",
    "3. WizardLm is a Llama-based model, force the model to bypass the GPU configuration may cause new issues."

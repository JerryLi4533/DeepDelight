10/22/2023 [Updated findings and part 2 data]

## Updates and Findings
Updates: 
- Tried different chunk and overlapping ratios based on the 10 questions, recorded all information observed
- Update the prompt message, but there are no changes for the returned answers.

Findings: 
1. When chunk_size = 5000, chunk_overlap can not larger than 100. Otherwise there would be "ERROR: The prompt size exceeds the context window size and cannot be processed." due to the model limitations.
2. Question 10 only be answered by (500, 0) situation, might because of accident.
3. Larger proportion of overlaping does not guarantee better results (1000, 200).
4. As chunk size increases, some previous correct answered questions can't give the correct answer anymore.
5. For some questions (Question 3, 8, 9), larger chunk size do demonstrate a better result, but question type can be the main factor.
6. Potential randomness that causes incorrect answer during spliting.

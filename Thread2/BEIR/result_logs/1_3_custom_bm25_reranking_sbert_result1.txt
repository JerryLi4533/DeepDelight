A line scan diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequence with diffusion tensor analysis was applied to measure the apparent diffusion coefficient, to calculate relative anisotropy, and to delineate three-dimensional fiber architecture in cerebral white matter in preterm (n = 17) and full-term infants (n = 7). To assess effects of prematurity on cerebral white matter development, early gestation preterm infants (n = 10) were studied a second time at term. In the central white matter the mean apparent diffusion coefficient at 28 wk was high, 1.8 microm2/ms, and decreased toward term to 1.2 microm2/ms. In the posterior limb of the internal capsule, the mean apparent diffusion coefficients at both times were similar (1.2 versus 1.1 microm2/ms). Relative anisotropy was higher the closer birth was to term with greater absolute values in the internal capsule than in the central white matter. Preterm infants at term showed higher mean diffusion coefficients in the central white matter (1.4 +/- 0.24 versus 1.15 +/- 0.09 microm2/ms, p = 0.016) and lower relative anisotropy in both areas compared with full-term infants (white matter, 10.9 +/- 0.6 versus 22.9 +/- 3.0%, p = 0.001; internal capsule, 24.0 +/- 4.44 versus 33.1 +/- 0.6% p = 0.006). Nonmyelinated fibers in the corpus callosum were visible by diffusion tensor MRI as early as 28 wk; full-term and preterm infants at term showed marked differences in white matter fiber organization. The data indicate that quantitative assessment of water diffusion by diffusion tensor MRI provides insight into microstructural development in cerebral white matter in living infants.', 'title': 'Microstructural development of human newborn cerebral white matter assessed in vivo by diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging.'}

2024-07-30 19:25:12 - Query : Hypoglycemia increases the risk of dementia.

2024-07-30 19:25:12 - Rank 1: 13282296 [Hypoglycemic episodes and risk of dementia in older patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.] - CONTEXT Although acute hypoglycemia may be associated with cognitive impairment in children with type 1 diabetes, no studies to date have evaluated whether hypoglycemia is a risk factor for dementia in older patients with type 2 diabetes. OBJECTIVE To determine if hypoglycemic episodes severe enough to require hospitalization are associated with an increased risk of dementia in a population of older patients with type 2 diabetes followed up for 27 years. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS A longitudinal cohort study from 1980-2007 of 16,667 patients with a mean age of 65 years and type 2 diabetes who are members of an integrated health care delivery system in northern California. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Hypoglycemic events from 1980-2002 were collected and reviewed using hospital discharge and emergency department diagnoses. Cohort members with no prior diagnoses of dementia, mild cognitive impairment, or general memory complaints as of January 1, 2003, were followed up for a dementia diagnosis through January 15, 2007. Dementia risk was examined using Cox proportional hazard regression models, adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, body mass index, duration of diabetes, 7-year mean glycated hemoglobin, diabetes treatment, duration of insulin use, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, stroke, transient cerebral ischemia, and end-stage renal disease. RESULTS At least 1 episode of hypoglycemia was diagnosed in 1465 patients (8.8%) and dementia was diagnosed in 1822 patients (11%) during follow-up; 250 patients had both dementia and at least 1 episode of hypoglycemia (16.95%). Compared with patients with no hypoglycemia, patients with single or multiple episodes had a graded increase in risk with fully adjusted hazard ratios (HRs): for 1 episode (HR, 1.26; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.10-1.49); 2 episodes (HR, 1.80; 95% CI, 1.37-2.36); and 3 or more episodes (HR, 1.94; 95% CI, 1.42-2.64). The attributable risk of dementia between individuals with and without a history of hypoglycemia was 2.39% per year (95% CI, 1.72%-3.01%). Results were not attenuated when medical utilization rates, length of health plan membership, or time since initial diabetes diagnosis were added to the model. When examining emergency department admissions for hypoglycemia for association with risk of dementia (535 episodes), results were similar (compared with patients with 0 episodes) with fully adjusted HRs: for 1 episode (HR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.12-1.78) and for 2 or more episodes (HR, 2.36; 95% CI, 1.57-3.55). CONCLUSIONS Among older patients with type 2 diabetes, a history of severe hypoglycemic episodes was associated with a greater risk of dementia. Whether minor hypoglycemic episodes increase risk of dementia is unknown.

2024-07-30 19:25:12 - Rank 2: 11953232 [Impaired Awareness of Hypoglycemia in a Population-Based Sample of Children and Adolescents With Type 1 Diabetes] - OBJECTIVE To determine the prevalence and clinical associations of impaired awareness of hypoglycemia in a population-based sample of children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS A validated questionnaire was administered to 656 patients with type 1 diabetes over a 6-month period to determine hypoglycemia awareness status. Case ascertainment was 79% of the clinic population. The rate of severe hypoglycemia was determined by data collected prospectively in the preceding year. RESULTS Impaired awareness of hypoglycemia was present in 29% of patients. Patients with impaired awareness of hypoglycemia had an earlier onset of diabetes (P < 0.001), were younger (P < 0.001), and had lower mean levels of A1C since diabetes onset (P = 0.006) and at their last visit (P = 0.001). The overall rate of severe hypoglycemia was 24.5 episodes per 100 patient-years in the preceding year. The severe hypoglycemia rate was higher in those with impaired awareness of hypoglycemia (37.1 vs. 19.3 episodes per 100 patient-years, P < 0.001). Among patients aged <6 years (n = 46), 59% of care providers reported impaired awareness of hypoglycemia, and the rate of severe hypoglycemia was significantly higher in those reporting impaired awareness (33.3 vs. 52 episodes per 100 patient-years, P = 0.02). More patients with recurrent hypoglycemia reported impaired awareness of hypoglycemia (47 vs. 28%, P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS A significant proportion of children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes have impaired awareness of hypoglycemia. Screening for impaired awareness is an important component of routine diabetes care and can identify patients at increased risk of a severe hypoglycemic event.

2024-07-30 19:25:12 - Rank 3: 21472388 [Hypoglycemia: incidence and clinical predictors in a large population-based sample of children and adolescents with IDDM.] - OBJECTIVE To determine the frequency of moderate and severe hypoglycemia and to identify clinical predictors associated with its occurrence in a large population-based sample of children and adolescents with IDDM. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS A total of 657 patients (age: 12.1 +/- 4.4 years, mean +/- SD) were included in the study, yielding 1,449 patient-years of data. A prospective assessment of severe hypoglycemia (an event resulting in a seizure or coma) and moderate hypoglycemia (an event requiring assistance of another, excluding severe episodes) was made over a 3-year period. Patients and caregivers detailed episodes of significant hypoglycemia (moderate and severe events) and these were recorded at each 3-month clinic visit along with HbA1c. Data were analyzed using generalized estimating equation models fitted with the exchange correlation structure. RESULTS The overall incidence of severe events was 4.8/100 patient-years and of moderate events was 13.1/100 patient-years. Over 3 years, severe events occurred in 8.5% of children and moderate events occurred in 26.9%. Significant hypoglycemia was rare in the first 12 months after diagnosis. Rates of hypoglycemia were increased in children < 6 years of age versus > 6 years of age (40.9 vs. 16.6/100 patient-years, age < or = 6 years vs. age > 6 years, P < 0.001). Rates of hypoglycemia doubled when HbA1c fell below 8%, and children with HbA1c < 7% had a threefold increase in both moderate and severe hypoglycemia (e.g., severe episodes 14.9 vs. 4.1/100 patient-years, HbA1c < or = 7% vs. HbA1c > 7%, P < 0.001). Most severe events were seizures, and 75% of them occurred at night. The majority of events were related to missed meals or increased activity. However, in 38% no predisposing factor was evident. CONCLUSIONS Newly diagnosed children appear to be protected from severe hypoglycemia. Rates increase with lower glycated hemoglobin, especially when mean HbA1c is < 8.0%. Younger children, who may be more susceptible to the adverse effects of neuroglycopenia, are at a particular risk of significant hypoglycemia.

2024-07-30 19:25:12 - Rank 4: 24921368 [Impaired awareness of hypoglycaemia: a review.] - Impaired awareness of hypoglycaemia (IAH) is an acquired complication of insulin therapy, which affects people with type 1 and insulin-treated type 2 diabetes mellitus, whereby the ability to perceive the onset of hypoglycaemia becomes diminished or absent. Deficiencies of the counter-regulatory hormonal responses to hypoglycaemia usually co-exist. The development of IAH and counter-regulatory failure greatly increases the risk of severe hypoglycaemia. Scoring systems have been developed that can be used in the clinical setting and assist with identification of this group of individuals at risk of severe hypoglycaemia. The mainstay of treatment of IAH is the scrupulous avoidance of hypoglycaemia.

2024-07-30 19:25:12 - Rank 5: 7011850 [Unawareness of hypoglycaemia and inadequate hypoglycaemic counterregulation: no causal relation with diabetic autonomic neuropathy.] - OBJECTIVE To examine the traditional view that unawareness of hypoglycaemia and inadequate hypoglycaemic counterregulation in insulin dependent diabetes mellitus are manifestations of autonomic neuropathy. DESIGN Perspective assessment of unawareness of hypoglycaemia and detailed assessment of autonomic neuropathy in patients with insulin dependent diabetes according to the adequacy of their hypoglycaemic counterregulation. SETTING One routine diabetic unit in a university teaching hospital. PATIENTS 23 Patients aged 21-52 with insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (seven with symptoms suggesting autonomic neuropathy, nine with a serious clinical problem with hypoglycaemia, and seven without symptoms of autonomic neuropathy and without problems with hypoglycaemia) and 10 controls with a similar age distribution, without a personal or family history of diabetes. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Presence of autonomic neuropathy as assessed with a test of the longest sympathetic fibres (acetylcholine sweatspot test), a pupil test, and a battery of seven cardiovascular autonomic function tests; adequacy of hypoglycaemic glucose counterregulation during a 40 mU/kg/h insulin infusion test; history of unawareness of hypoglycaemia; and response of plasma pancreatic polypeptide during hypoglycaemia, which depends on an intact and responding autonomic innervation of the pancreas. RESULTS There was little evidence of autonomic neuropathy in either the 12 diabetic patients with a history of unawareness of hypoglycaemia or the seven patients with inadequate hypoglycaemic counterregulation. By contrast, in all seven patients with clear evidence of autonomic neuropathy there was no history of unawareness of hypoglycaemia and in six out of seven there was adequate hypoglycaemic counterregulation. Unawareness of hypoglycaemia and inadequate hypoglycaemic counterregulation were significantly associated (p less than 0.01). The response of plasma pancreatic polypeptide in the diabetic patients with adequate counterregulation but without autonomic neuropathy was not significantly different from that of the controls (change in plasma pancreatic polypeptide 226.8 v 414 pmol/l). The patients with autonomic neuropathy had a negligible plasma pancreatic polypeptide response (3.7 pmol/l), but this response was also blunted in the patients with inadequate hypoglycaemic counterregulation (72.4 pmol/l) compared with that of the controls (p less than 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Unawareness of hypoglycaemia and inadequate glucose counterregulation during hypoglycaemia are related to each other but are not due to autonomic neuropathy. The blunted plasma pancreatic polypeptide responses of the patients with inadequate hypoglycaemic counterregulation may reflect diminished autonomic activity consequent upon reduced responsiveness of a central glucoregulatory centre, rather than classical autonomic neuropathy.

2024-07-30 19:25:12 - Rank 6: 20697217 [Symptoms of hypoglycemia in children with IDDM.] - OBJECTIVE To examine the symptoms of hypoglycemia in children with insulin-dependent diabetes, from the perspective both of the child and of the child's parents, and to compare the symptom reporting of the diabetic children with that of adult diabetic patients. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Interviews were conducted with 100 parents and 43 of their children. The frequency and intensity of symptoms of hypoglycemia were documented using a structured interview and classified into groups using Principal Components Analysis (PCA). RESULTS Diabetic children and their parents showed close agreement concerning the relative frequency and the intensity of symptoms reported. PCA of the symptom reports showed that diabetic children and their parents identified the same distinct subgroups of hypoglycemia-related symptoms: behavioral disturbance and autonomic-neuroglycopenic subgroups. CONCLUSIONS Hypoglycemic symptoms in children with diabetes clearly differ from those experienced by insulin-treated adults and, in particular, include behavioral changes as primary features of a low blood glucose. These observations have important implications for parental education on hypoglycemia.

2024-07-30 19:25:12 - Rank 7: 32463364 [Antihypertensive classes, cognitive decline and incidence of dementia: a network meta-analysis.] - OBJECTIVES Prevention of cognitive decline and dementia with blood pressure lowering treatments has shown inconsistent results. We compared the effects of different classes of antihypertensive drugs on the incidence of dementia, and on cognitive function. METHODS We conducted a systematic review and included 19 randomized trials (18 515 individuals) and 11 studies (831 674 individuals) analysing the effects of antihypertensive treatment on cognition and on the incidence of dementia, respectively, in hypertensive patients without prior cerebrovascular disorders. Network meta-analysis was used for the comparison of antihypertensive classes. RESULTS Antihypertensive treatment, regardless of the drug class, had benefits on overall cognition [effect size 0.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.02-0.07] and all cognitive functions except language. Antihypertensive treatment reduced the risk of all-cause dementia by 9%, with reference to the control group (hazard ratio 0.91, 95% CI 0.89-0.94), when randomized trials and observationnal studies were combined (n = 15). Result was not significant with randomized trials alone (n = 4). Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) had larger benefits than placebo on overall cognition (adjusted effect size 0.60 ± 0.18, P = 0.02). ARBs were more effective than β-blockers (0.67 ± 0.18, P = 0.01), diuretics (0.54 ± 0.19, P = 0.04) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (0.47 ± 0.17, P = 0.04) in rank. The mean change in blood pressure did not differ significantly between the different antihypertensive drug classes. CONCLUSION Our results support the notion that antihypertensive treatment has beneficial effects on cognitive decline and prevention of dementia, and indicate that these effects may differ between drug classes with ARBs possibly being the most effective.

2024-07-30 19:25:12 - Rank 8: 4886637 [Diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and breast cancer: a review of the current evidence.] - Incidences of breast cancer, type 2 diabetes, and metabolic syndrome have increased over the past decades with the obesity epidemic, especially in industrialized countries. Insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, and changes in the signaling of growth hormones and steroid hormones associated with diabetes may affect the risk of breast cancer. We reviewed epidemiologic studies of the association between type 2 diabetes and risk of breast cancer and the available evidence on the role of hormonal mediators of an association between diabetes and breast cancer. The combined evidence supports a modest association between type 2 diabetes and the risk of breast cancer, which appears to be more consistent among postmenopausal than among premenopausal women. Despite many proposed potential pathways, the mechanisms underlying an association between diabetes and breast cancer risk remain unclear, particularly because the 2 diseases share several risk factors, including obesity, a sedentary lifestyle, and possibly intake of saturated fat and refined carbohydrates, that may confound this association. Although the metabolic syndrome is closely related to diabetes and embraces additional components that might influence breast cancer risk, the role of the metabolic syndrome in breast carcinogenesis has not been studied and thus remains unknown.

2024-07-30 19:25:12 - Rank 9: 11616424 [Copyright � 1996, American Society for Microbiology Endotoxin-Induced Enhancement of Glucose Influx into] - Hypoglycemia is among the most injurious metabolic disorders caused by endotoxemia. In experimental endotoxemia with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in animals, a marked glucose consumption is observed in macrophage-rich organs. However, the direct effect of LPS on the uptake of glucose by macrophages has not been fully understood, and the present study was undertaken to shed light on this point. The consumption and uptake of glucose, as measured with 2-deoxy-D-[3H]glucose, by murine peritoneal exudate macrophages in culture were accelerated two- to threefold by stimulation with 3 ng of LPS per ml. The rate of glucose uptake reached a plateau after 20 min of stimulation and remained at the maximum as long as LPS was present. Northern (RNA) blot analysis with cDNA probes for five known isoforms of glucose transporter (GLUT) revealed that the expression of GLUT by macrophages was restricted to the GLUT1 isoform during LPS stimulation and the amount of GLUT1 mRNA was increased by the stimulation. These results suggest that macrophage responses to LPS are supported by a rapid and sustained glucose influx via GLUT1 and that this is a participating factor in the development of systemic hypoglycemia when endotoxemia is prolonged.

2024-07-30 19:25:12 - Rank 10: 8868863 [Interactions between sleep, circadian function, and glucose metabolism: implications for risk and severity of diabetes.] - Sleep disturbances, including sleep insufficiency and sleep fragmentation, have been linked to abnormal glucose metabolism and increased diabetes risk. Well-controlled laboratory studies have provided insights regarding the underlying mechanisms. Several large prospective studies suggest that these sleep disturbances are associated with an increased risk of incident diabetes. Obstructive sleep apnea, which combines sleep fragmentation and hypoxemia, is a major risk factor for insulin resistance and possibly diabetes. Whether glycemic control in type 2 diabetes patients can be improved by treating sleep apnea remains controversial. Recently, sleep disturbances during pregnancy and their relationship to gestational diabetes and hyperglycemia have received considerable attention owing to potential adverse effects on maternal and fetal health. Additionally, evidence from animal models has identified disruption of the circadian system as a putative risk factor for adverse metabolic outcomes. The purpose of this review is to provide an update on the current state of knowledge linking sleep disturbances, circadian dysfunction, and glucose metabolism. Experimental, prospective, and interventional studies are discussed.

A line scan diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequence with diffusion tensor analysis was applied to measure the apparent diffusion coefficient, to calculate relative anisotropy, and to delineate three-dimensional fiber architecture in cerebral white matter in preterm (n = 17) and full-term infants (n = 7). To assess effects of prematurity on cerebral white matter development, early gestation preterm infants (n = 10) were studied a second time at term. In the central white matter the mean apparent diffusion coefficient at 28 wk was high, 1.8 microm2/ms, and decreased toward term to 1.2 microm2/ms. In the posterior limb of the internal capsule, the mean apparent diffusion coefficients at both times were similar (1.2 versus 1.1 microm2/ms). Relative anisotropy was higher the closer birth was to term with greater absolute values in the internal capsule than in the central white matter. Preterm infants at term showed higher mean diffusion coefficients in the central white matter (1.4 +/- 0.24 versus 1.15 +/- 0.09 microm2/ms, p = 0.016) and lower relative anisotropy in both areas compared with full-term infants (white matter, 10.9 +/- 0.6 versus 22.9 +/- 3.0%, p = 0.001; internal capsule, 24.0 +/- 4.44 versus 33.1 +/- 0.6% p = 0.006). Nonmyelinated fibers in the corpus callosum were visible by diffusion tensor MRI as early as 28 wk; full-term and preterm infants at term showed marked differences in white matter fiber organization. The data indicate that quantitative assessment of water diffusion by diffusion tensor MRI provides insight into microstructural development in cerebral white matter in living infants.', 'title': 'Microstructural development of human newborn cerebral white matter assessed in vivo by diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging.'}

2024-09-23 04:04:53 - Query : Mutant mice lacking SVCT2 have greatly increased ascorbic acid levels in both brain and adrenals.

2024-09-23 04:04:53 - Rank 1: 19799455 [Ascorbic-acid transporter Slc23a1 is essential for vitamin C transport into the brain and for perinatal survival] - The only proven requirement for ascorbic acid (vitamin C) is in preventing scurvy, presumably because it is a cofactor for hydroxylases required for post-translational modifications that stabilize collagen. We have created mice deficient in the mouse ortholog (solute carrier family 23 member 1 or Slc23a1) of a rat ascorbic-acid transporter, Svct2 (ref. 4). Cultured embryonic fibroblasts from homozygous Slc23a1−/− mice had less than 5% of normal ascorbic-acid uptake. Ascorbic-acid levels were undetectable or markedly reduced in the blood and tissues of Slc23a1−/− mice. Prenatal supplementation of pregnant females did not elevate blood ascorbic acid in Slc23a1−/− fetuses, suggesting Slc23a1 is important in placental ascorbic-acid transport. Slc23a1−/− mice died within a few minutes of birth with respiratory failure and intraparenchymal brain hemorrhage. Lungs showed no postnatal expansion but had normal surfactant protein B levels. Brain hemorrhage was unlikely to be simply a form of scurvy since Slc23a1−/− mice showed no hemorrhage in any other tissues and their skin had normal skin 4-hydroxyproline levels despite low ascorbic-acid content. We conclude that Slc23a1 is required for transport of ascorbic acid into many tissues and across the placenta. Deficiency of the transporter is lethal in newborn mice, thereby revealing a previously unrecognized requirement for ascorbic acid in the perinatal period.

2024-09-23 04:04:53 - Rank 2: 13001323 [SIRT1 deacetylase in SF1 neurons protects against metabolic imbalance.] - Chronic feeding on high-calorie diets causes obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), illnesses that affect hundreds of millions. Thus, understanding the pathways protecting against diet-induced metabolic imbalance is of paramount medical importance. Here, we show that mice lacking SIRT1 in steroidogenic factor 1 (SF1) neurons are hypersensitive to dietary obesity owing to maladaptive energy expenditure. Also, mutant mice have increased susceptibility to developing dietary T2DM due to insulin resistance in skeletal muscle. Mechanistically, these aberrations arise, in part, from impaired metabolic actions of the neuropeptide orexin-A and the hormone leptin. Conversely, mice overexpressing SIRT1 in SF1 neurons are more resistant to diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance due to increased energy expenditure and enhanced skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity. Our results unveil important protective roles of SIRT1 in SF1 neurons against dietary metabolic imbalance.

2024-09-23 04:04:53 - Rank 3: 34733465 [Association of cystic fibrosis with abnormalities in fatty acid metabolism.] - BACKGROUND Patients with cystic fibrosis have altered levels of plasma fatty acids. We previously demonstrated that arachidonic acid levels are increased and docosahexaenoic acid levels are decreased in affected tissues from cystic fibrosis-knockout mice. In this study we determined whether humans with mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene have a similar fatty acid defect in tissues expressing CFTR. METHODS Fatty acids from nasal- and rectal-biopsy specimens, nasal epithelial scrapings, and plasma were analyzed from 38 subjects with cystic fibrosis and compared with results in 13 obligate heterozygotes, 24 healthy controls, 11 subjects with inflammatory bowel disease, 9 subjects with upper respiratory tract infection, and 16 subjects with asthma. RESULTS The ratio of arachidonic to docosahexaenoic acid was increased in mucosal and submucosal nasal-biopsy specimens (P<0.001) and rectal-biopsy specimens (P=0.009) from subjects with cystic fibrosis and pancreatic sufficiency and subjects with cystic fibrosis and pancreatic insufficiency, as compared with values in healthy control subjects. In nasal tissue, this change reflected an increase in arachidonic acid levels and a decrease in docosahexaenoic acid levels. In cells from nasal mucosa, the ratio of arachidonic to docosahexaenoic acid was increased in subjects with cystic fibrosis (P<0.001), as compared with healthy controls, with values in obligate heterozygotes intermediate between these two groups (P<0.001). The ratio was not increased in subjects with inflammatory bowel disease. Subjects with asthma and those with upper respiratory tract infection had values intermediate between those in subjects with cystic fibrosis and those in healthy control subjects. CONCLUSIONS These data indicate that alterations in fatty acids similar to those in cystic fibrosis-knockout mice are present in CFTR-expressing tissue from subjects with cystic fibrosis.

2024-09-23 04:04:53 - Rank 4: 43014661 [Increased susceptibility to UV-induced skin carcinogenesis in polymerase eta-deficient mice.] - Xeroderma pigmentosum variant (XPV) patients with mutations in the DNA polymerase eta (pol eta) gene are hypersensitive to sunlight and have greatly increased susceptibility to sunlight-induced skin cancer. Consistent with the ability of Pol eta to efficiently bypass UV light-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers, XPV cells lacking Pol eta have diminished capacity to replicate UV-damaged DNA and are sensitive to UV light-induced killing and mutagenesis. To better understand these and other Pol eta functions, we generated Pol eta-deficient mice. Mice homozygous for a null mutation in pol eta are viable, fertile, and do not show any obvious spontaneous defects during the first year of life. However, fibroblasts derived from these mutant mice are sensitive to killing by exposure to UV light, and all Pol eta-deficient mice develop skin tumors after UV irradiation, in contrast to the wild-type littermate controls that did not develop such tumors. These results and biochemical studies of translesion synthesis by mouse Pol eta indicate that Pol eta-dependent bypass of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers suppresses UV light-induced skin cancer in mice. Moreover, 37.5% of pol eta heterozygous mice also developed skin cancer during 5 months after a 5-month exposure to UV light, suggesting that humans who are heterozygous for mutations in pol eta may also have an increased risk of skin cancer.

2024-09-23 04:04:53 - Rank 5: 2436602 [β-Adrenergic receptor antagonism prevents anxiety-like behavior and microglial reactivity induced by repeated social defeat.] - Psychosocial stress is associated with altered immune function and development of psychological disorders including anxiety and depression. Here we show that repeated social defeat in mice increased c-Fos staining in brain regions associated with fear and threat appraisal and promoted anxiety-like behavior in a β-adrenergic receptor-dependent manner. Repeated social defeat also significantly increased the number of CD11b(+)/CD45(high)/Ly6C(high) macrophages that trafficked to the brain. In addition, several inflammatory markers were increased on the surface of microglia (CD14, CD86, and TLR4) and macrophages (CD14 and CD86) after social defeat. Repeated social defeat also increased the presence of deramified microglia in the medial amygdala, prefrontal cortex, and hippocampus. Moreover, mRNA analysis of microglia indicated that repeated social defeat increased levels of interleukin (IL)-1β and reduced levels of glucocorticoid responsive genes [glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper (GILZ) and FK506 binding protein-51 (FKBP51)]. The stress-dependent changes in microglia and macrophages were prevented by propranolol, a β-adrenergic receptor antagonist. Microglia isolated from socially defeated mice and cultured ex vivo produced markedly higher levels of IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 after stimulation with lipopolysaccharide compared with microglia from control mice. Last, repeated social defeat increased c-Fos activation in IL-1 receptor type-1-deficient mice, but did not promote anxiety-like behavior or microglia activation in the absence of functional IL-1 receptor type-1. These findings indicate that repeated social defeat-induced anxiety-like behavior and enhanced reactivity of microglia was dependent on activation of β-adrenergic and IL-1 receptors.

2024-09-23 04:04:53 - Rank 6: 41644178 [Increased dendritic complexity and axonal length in cultured mouse cortical neurons overexpressing methyl-CpG-binding protein MeCP2] - Rett syndrome is caused by loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding the methyl DNA-binding factor MeCP2. As brain mass and neuronal complexity tend to be diminished in Rett patients, we tested whether MeCP2 directly influences the morphological complexity of developing neurons. Our results show that cultured mouse neurons overexpressing MeCP2beta (MECP2A) develop more complex morphologies, having longer axonal and dendritic processes, and an increased number of axonal and dendritic terminal endings. We then tested whether overexpressing a mutant form of MeCP2beta lacking its carboxyl terminus would elicit the same effects. Interestingly, while neurons overexpressing this mutant failed to enhance axonal and dendritic process elongation, the complexity of their axonal and dendritic processes remained significantly elevated. Taken together, these data support the hypothesis that MeCP2 directly regulates neuronal maturation and/or synaptogenesis, and provides evidence that MeCP2 may influence neuritic elongation and process branching through different mechanisms.

2024-09-23 04:04:53 - Rank 7: 2481032 [Neuronal Sirt1 deficiency increases insulin sensitivity in both brain and peripheral tissues.] - Sirt1 is a NAD(+)-dependent class III deacetylase that functions as a cellular energy sensor. In addition to its well-characterized effects in peripheral tissues, emerging evidence suggests that neuronal Sirt1 activity plays a role in the central regulation of energy balance and glucose metabolism. To assess this idea, we generated Sirt1 neuron-specific knockout (SINKO) mice. On both standard chow and HFD, SINKO mice were more insulin sensitive than Sirt1(f/f) mice. Thus, SINKO mice had lower fasting insulin levels, improved glucose tolerance and insulin tolerance, and enhanced systemic insulin sensitivity during hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp studies. Hypothalamic insulin sensitivity of SINKO mice was also increased over controls, as assessed by hypothalamic activation of PI3K, phosphorylation of Akt and FoxO1 following systemic insulin injection. Intracerebroventricular injection of insulin led to a greater systemic effect to improve glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in SINKO mice compared with controls. In line with the in vivo results, insulin-induced AKT and FoxO1 phosphorylation were potentiated by inhibition of Sirt1 in a cultured hypothalamic cell line. Mechanistically, this effect was traced to a reduced effect of Sirt1 to directly deacetylate and repress IRS-1 function. The enhanced central insulin signaling in SINKO mice was accompanied by increased insulin receptor signal transduction in liver, muscle, and adipose tissue. In summary, we conclude that neuronal Sirt1 negatively regulates hypothalamic insulin signaling, leading to systemic insulin resistance. Interventions that reduce neuronal Sirt1 activity have the potential to improve systemic insulin action and limit weight gain on an obesigenic diet.

2024-09-23 04:04:53 - Rank 8: 21878751 [Mice deficient in CD4 T cells have only transiently diminished levels of IFN-gamma, yet succumb to tuberculosis.] - CD4 T cells are important in the protective immune response against tuberculosis. Two mouse models deficient in CD4 T cells were used to examine the mechanism by which these cells participate in protection against Mycobacterium tuberculosis challenge. Transgenic mice deficient in either MHC class II or CD4 molecules demonstrated increased susceptibility to M. tuberculosis, compared with wild-type mice. MHC class II-/- mice were more susceptible than CD4-/- mice, as measured by survival following M. tuberculosis challenge, but the relative resistance of CD4-/- mice did not appear to be due to increased numbers of CD4-8- (double-negative) T cells. Analysis of in vivo IFN-gamma production in the lungs of infected mice revealed that both mutant mouse strains were only transiently impaired in their ability to produce IFN-gamma following infection. At 2 wk postinfection, IFN-gamma production, assessed by RT-PCR and intracellular cytokine staining, in the mutant mice was reduced by >50% compared with that in wild-type mice. However, by 4 wk postinfection, both mutant and wild-type mice had similar levels of IFN-gamma mRNA and protein production. In CD4 T cell-deficient mice, IFN-gamma production was due to CD8 T cells. Thus, the importance of IFN-gamma production by CD4 T cells appears to be early in infection, lending support to the hypothesis that early events in M. tuberculosis infection are crucial determinants of the course of infection.

2024-09-23 04:04:53 - Rank 9: 17081238 [Specific deficit of the ON response in visual transmission by targeted disruption of the mGIuR6 gene] - Taking advantage of the restricted expression of metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 6 (mGluR6) in retinal ON bipolar cells, we generated knockout mice lacking mGluR6 expression. The homozygous mutant mice showed a loss of ON responses but unchanged OFF responses to light. The mutant mice displayed no obvious changes in retinal cell organization nor in the projection of optic fibers to the brain. Furthermore, the mGluR6-deficient mice showed visual behavioral responses to light stimulation as examined by shuttle box avoidance behavior experiments using light exposure as a conditioned stimulus. The results demonstrate that mGluR6 is essential in synaptic transmission to the ON bipolar cell and that the OFF response provides an important means for transmitting visual information.

2024-09-23 04:04:53 - Rank 10: 3553087 [Mitochondrial iron chelation ameliorates cigarette-smoke induced bronchitis and emphysema in mice] - Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is linked to both cigarette smoking and genetic determinants. We have previously identified iron-responsive element-binding protein 2 (IRP2) as an important COPD susceptibility gene and have shown that IRP2 protein is increased in the lungs of individuals with COPD. Here we demonstrate that mice deficient in Irp2 were protected from cigarette smoke (CS)-induced experimental COPD. By integrating RNA immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (RIP-seq), RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), and gene expression and functional enrichment clustering analysis, we identified Irp2 as a regulator of mitochondrial function in the lungs of mice. Irp2 increased mitochondrial iron loading and levels of cytochrome c oxidase (COX), which led to mitochondrial dysfunction and subsequent experimental COPD. Frataxin-deficient mice, which had higher mitochondrial iron loading, showed impaired airway mucociliary clearance (MCC) and higher pulmonary inflammation at baseline, whereas mice deficient in the synthesis of cytochrome c oxidase, which have reduced COX, were protected from CS-induced pulmonary inflammation and impairment of MCC. Mice treated with a mitochondrial iron chelator or mice fed a low-iron diet were protected from CS-induced COPD. Mitochondrial iron chelation also alleviated CS-induced impairment of MCC, CS-induced pulmonary inflammation and CS-associated lung injury in mice with established COPD, suggesting a critical functional role and potential therapeutic intervention for the mitochondrial-iron axis in COPD.

A line scan diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequence with diffusion tensor analysis was applied to measure the apparent diffusion coefficient, to calculate relative anisotropy, and to delineate three-dimensional fiber architecture in cerebral white matter in preterm (n = 17) and full-term infants (n = 7). To assess effects of prematurity on cerebral white matter development, early gestation preterm infants (n = 10) were studied a second time at term. In the central white matter the mean apparent diffusion coefficient at 28 wk was high, 1.8 microm2/ms, and decreased toward term to 1.2 microm2/ms. In the posterior limb of the internal capsule, the mean apparent diffusion coefficients at both times were similar (1.2 versus 1.1 microm2/ms). Relative anisotropy was higher the closer birth was to term with greater absolute values in the internal capsule than in the central white matter. Preterm infants at term showed higher mean diffusion coefficients in the central white matter (1.4 +/- 0.24 versus 1.15 +/- 0.09 microm2/ms, p = 0.016) and lower relative anisotropy in both areas compared with full-term infants (white matter, 10.9 +/- 0.6 versus 22.9 +/- 3.0%, p = 0.001; internal capsule, 24.0 +/- 4.44 versus 33.1 +/- 0.6% p = 0.006). Nonmyelinated fibers in the corpus callosum were visible by diffusion tensor MRI as early as 28 wk; full-term and preterm infants at term showed marked differences in white matter fiber organization. The data indicate that quantitative assessment of water diffusion by diffusion tensor MRI provides insight into microstructural development in cerebral white matter in living infants.', 'title': 'Microstructural development of human newborn cerebral white matter assessed in vivo by diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging.'}

2024-09-29 00:26:44 - Rank 1: 13923069 [Targeted nanoparticles containing the proresolving peptide Ac2-26 protect against advanced atherosclerosis in hypercholesterolemic mice] - Chronic, nonresolving inflammation is a critical factor in the clinical progression of advanced atherosclerotic lesions. In the normal inflammatory response, resolution is mediated by several agonists, among which is the glucocorticoid-regulated protein called annexin A1. The proresolving actions of annexin A1, which are mediated through its receptor N-formyl peptide receptor 2 (FPR2/ALX), can be mimicked by an amino-terminal peptide encompassing amino acids 2–26 (Ac2-26). Collagen IV (Col IV)–targeted nanoparticles (NPs) containing Ac2-26 were evaluated for their therapeutic effect on chronic, advanced atherosclerosis in fat-fed Ldlr−/− mice. When administered to mice with preexisting lesions, Col IV–Ac2-26 NPs were targeted to lesions and led to a marked improvement in key advanced plaque properties, including an increase in the protective collagen layer overlying lesions (which was associated with a decrease in lesional collagenase activity), suppression of oxidative stress, and a decrease in plaque necrosis. In mice lacking FPR2/ALX in myeloid cells, these improvements were not seen. Thus, administration of a resolution-mediating peptide in a targeted NP activates its receptor on myeloid cells to stabilize advanced atherosclerotic lesions. These findings support the concept that defective inflammation resolution plays a role in advanced atherosclerosis, and suggest a new form of therapy. (Score: 17.753014)

2024-09-29 00:26:44 - Rank 2: 19343151 [p16INK4A is a robust in vivo biomarker of cellular aging in human skin.] - The cell-cycle regulating gene, p16INK4A, encoding an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6, is considered to play an important role in cellular aging and in premature senescence. Although there is an age-dependent increase of p16INK4A expression in human fibroblast senescence in vitro, no data are available regarding the age dependency of p16INK4A in vivo. To determine whether p16INK4A expression in human skin correlates with donor age, p16INK4A expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry as well as the expression of the p16INK4A repressor BMI1. Samples from the age groups 0-20, 21-70, and 71-95 years were selected from a bank of healthy human skin. We show that the number of p16INK4A positive cells is significantly higher in elderly individuals compared to the younger age groups. The number of p16INK4A positive cells was found to be increased in both epidermis and dermis, compartments with strictly different proliferative activities. BMI1 gene expression was significantly down-regulated with increasing donor age, whereas no striking age differences were observed for Ki67. In immunofluorescence co-expression studies, Ki67-positive cells were negative for p16INK4A and BMI1-expressing cells also stained negatively for Ki67. In conclusion, we provide for the first time evidence that p16INK4A expression directly correlates with chronological aging of human skin in vivo. p16INK4A therefore is a biomarker for human aging in vivo. The data reported here suggest a model for changes in regulatory gene expression that drive aging in human skin. (Score: 15.332926)

2024-09-29 00:26:44 - Rank 3: 10698739 [Modulation of mitochondrial function and morphology by interaction of Omi/HtrA2 with the mitochondrial fusion factor OPA1.] - Loss of Omi/HtrA2 function leads to nerve cell loss in mouse models and has been linked to neurodegeneration in Parkinson's and Huntington's disease. Omi/HtrA2 is a serine protease released as a pro-apoptotic factor from the mitochondrial intermembrane space into the cytosol. Under physiological conditions, Omi/HtrA2 is thought to be involved in protection against cellular stress, but the cytological and molecular mechanisms are not clear. Omi/HtrA2 deficiency caused an accumulation of reactive oxygen species and reduced mitochondrial membrane potential. In Omi/HtrA2 knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts, as well as in Omi/HtrA2 silenced human HeLa cells and Drosophila S2R+ cells, we found elongated mitochondria by live cell imaging. Electron microscopy confirmed the mitochondrial morphology alterations and showed abnormal cristae structure. Examining the levels of proteins involved in mitochondrial fusion, we found a selective up-regulation of more soluble OPA1 protein. Complementation of knockout cells with wild-type Omi/HtrA2 but not with the protease mutant [S306A]Omi/HtrA2 reversed the mitochondrial elongation phenotype and OPA1 alterations. Finally, co-immunoprecipitation showed direct interaction of Omi/HtrA2 with endogenous OPA1. Thus, we show for the first time a direct effect of loss of Omi/HtrA2 on mitochondrial morphology and demonstrate a novel role of this mitochondrial serine protease in the modulation of OPA1. Our results underscore a critical role of impaired mitochondrial dynamics in neurodegenerative disorders. (Score: 15.234703)

2024-09-29 00:26:44 - Rank 4: 928281 [Failure of cell cleavage induces senescence in tetraploid primary cells] - Tetraploidy can arise from various mitotic or cleavage defects in mammalian cells, and inheritance of multiple centrosomes induces aneuploidy when tetraploid cells continue to cycle. Arrest of the tetraploid cell cycle is therefore potentially a critical cellular control. We report here that primary rat embryo fibroblasts (REF52) and human foreskin fibroblasts become senescent in tetraploid G1 after drug- or small interfering RNA (siRNA)-induced failure of cell cleavage. In contrast, T-antigen-transformed REF52 and p53+/+ HCT116 tumor cells rapidly become aneuploid by continuing to cycle after cleavage failure. Tetraploid primary cells quickly become quiescent, as determined by loss of the Ki-67 proliferation marker and of the fluorescent ubiquitination-based cell cycle indicator/late cell cycle marker geminin. Arrest is not due to DNA damage, as the γ-H2AX DNA damage marker remains at control levels after tetraploidy induction. Arrested tetraploid cells finally become senescent, as determined by SA-β-galactosidase activity. Tetraploid arrest is dependent on p16INK4a expression, as siRNA suppression of p16INK4a bypasses tetraploid arrest, permitting primary cells to become aneuploid. We conclude that tetraploid primary cells can become senescent without DNA damage and that induction of senescence is critical to tetraploidy arrest. (Score: 14.636602)

2024-09-29 00:26:44 - Rank 5: 4387484 [G-protein-coupled receptor of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus is a viral oncogene and angiogenesis activator.] - The Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV/HHV8) is a gamma-2 herpesvirus that is implicated in the pathogenesis of Kaposi's sarcoma and of primary effusion B-cell lymphomas (PELs). KSHV infects malignant and progenitor cells of Kaposi's sarcoma and PEL, it encodes putative oncogenes and genes that may cause Kaposi's sarcoma pathogenesis by stimulating angiogenesis. The G-protein-coupled receptor encoded by an open reading frame (ORF 74) of KSHV is expressed in Kaposi's sarcoma lesions and in PEL and stimulates signalling pathways linked to cell proliferation in a constitutive (agonist-independent) way. Here we show that signalling by this KSHV G-protein-coupled receptor leads to cell transformation and tumorigenicity, and induces a switch to an angiogenic phenotype mediated by vascular endothelial growth factor, an angiogenesis and Kaposi's-spindle-cell growth factor. We find that this receptor can activate two protein kinases, JNK/SAPK and p38MAPK, by triggering signalling cascades like those induced by inflammatory cytokines that are angiogenesis activators and mitogens for Kaposi's sarcoma cells and B cells. We conclude that the KSHV G-protein-coupled receptor is a viral oncogene that can exploit cell signalling pathways to induce transformation and angiogenesis in KSHV-mediated oncogenesis.

2024-09-29 00:26:44 - Rank 6: 40987633 [The role of CHMP2BIntron5 in autophagy and frontotemporal dementia.] - Charged multivesicular body protein 2B (CHMP2B) - a component of the endosomal complex required for transport-III (ESCRT-III) - is responsible for the vital membrane deformation functions in autophagy and endolysosomal trafficking. A dominant mutation in CHMP2B (CHMP2BIntron5) is associated with a subset of heritable frontotemporal dementia - frontotemporal dementia linked to chromosome 3 (FTD-3). ESCRT-III recruits Vps4, an AAA-ATPase that abscises the membrane during various cellular processes including autophagy and intraluminal vesicle formation. CHMP2BIntron5 results in a C-terminus truncation removing an important Vps4 binding site as well as eliminating the normal autoinhibitory resting state of CHMP2B. CHMP2B is expressed in most cell types but seems to be especially vital for proper neuronal function. CHMP2BIntron5-mediated phenotypes include misregulation of transmembrane receptors, accumulation of multilamellar structures, abnormal lysosomal morphology, down regulation of a brain-specific micro RNA (miRNA-124), abnormal dendritic spine morphology, decrease in dendritic arborization, and cell death. Currently, transgenic-fly,-mouse, and -human cell lines are being used to better understand the diverse phenotypes and develop therapeutic approaches for the CHMP2BIntron5-induced FTD-3. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled SI:Autophagy. (Score: 14.204871)

2024-09-29 00:26:44 - Rank 7: 15879931 [Regulated Accumulation of Desmosterol Integrates Macrophage Lipid Metabolism and Inflammatory Responses] - Inflammation and macrophage foam cells are characteristic features of atherosclerotic lesions, but the mechanisms linking cholesterol accumulation to inflammation and LXR-dependent response pathways are poorly understood. To investigate this relationship, we utilized lipidomic and transcriptomic methods to evaluate the effect of diet and LDL receptor genotype on macrophage foam cell formation within the peritoneal cavities of mice. Foam cell formation was associated with significant changes in hundreds of lipid species and unexpected suppression, rather than activation, of inflammatory gene expression. We provide evidence that regulated accumulation of desmosterol underlies many of the homeostatic responses, including activation of LXR target genes, inhibition of SREBP target genes, selective reprogramming of fatty acid metabolism, and suppression of inflammatory-response genes, observed in macrophage foam cells. These observations suggest that macrophage activation in atherosclerotic lesions results from extrinsic, proinflammatory signals generated within the artery wall that suppress homeostatic and anti-inflammatory functions of desmosterol.

Therefore, we examined the proportion of minimal PE in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and its impact on survival. We also considered possible accumulation mechanisms in our data set. PATIENTS AND METHODS On the basis of PE status from chest computed tomography scans at diagnosis, 2,061 patients were classified into three groups: no PE, minimal PE, and malignant PE. Twenty-one variables associated with four factors-patient, stage migration, tumor, and treatment-were investigated for correlation with survival. RESULTS Minimal PE presented in 272 patients (13.2%). Of 2,061 patients, the proportion of each stage was the following: 5.2% stage I, 10.9% stage II, 13.2% stage IIIA, 23.8% stage IIIB, and 13.9% stage IV. Minimal PE correlated significantly with shorter survival time than did no PE (median survival time, 7.7 v 17.7 months; log-rank P < .001), even after full adjustment with all variables (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.21 to 1.62). Prognostic impact of minimal PE was higher in early versus advanced stages (Pinteraction = .001). In 237 patients (87.8%) with minimal PE, pleural invasion or attachment as a direct mechanism was observed, and it was an independent factor predicting worse survival (P = .03). CONCLUSION Minimal PE is a commonly encountered clinical concern in staging NSCLCs. Its presence is an important prognostic factor of worse survival, especially in early-stage disease.

RESULTS RTQ-MSP was sufficiently sensitive to detect down to 10 genome-equivalents of methylated p16INK4a sequences. Quantitative MSP data were expressed in terms of the methylation index, which was the percentage of bisulfite converted unmethylated and methylated p16INK4a sequences that consisted of methylated p16INK4a sequences. Quantities of methylated p16INK4a sequences were detected in peripheral circulation of 80% (23 of 29) of HCC patients. No significant difference was seen in the detectability and concentrations of methylated p16INK4a sequences (range: 10-4046 genome-equivalents/ml) between preoperative plasma and serum samples from HCC patients. Preoperatively, the p16INK4a methylation indices ranged from 0.2 to 100% and from 0.012 to 0.075% in the patients' plasma and buffy coat samples, respectively. After surgical resection, the median p16INK4a methylation indices in plasma and buffy coat concordantly decreased 12- and 15-fold, respectively. These results demonstrated the clinical usefulness and effectiveness of peripheral blood RTQ-MSP for detecting and monitoring HCC after treatment. Furthermore, none of the intraoperative plasma samples and only two of the intraoperative buffy coat samples were p16INK4a methylation positive. CONCLUSIONS Quantification of epigenetic changes in peripheral blood by RTQ-MSP is useful for the detection and monitoring of HCC. (Score: 13.66663)

2024-09-29 00:26:44 - Rank 10: 1084345 [Restoration of chaperone-mediated autophagy in aging liver improves cellular maintenance and hepatic function] - Chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), a selective mechanism for degradation of cytosolic proteins in lysosomes, contributes to the removal of altered proteins as part of the cellular quality-control systems. We have previously found that CMA activity declines in aged organisms and have proposed that this failure in cellular clearance could contribute to the accumulation of altered proteins, the abnormal cellular homeostasis and, eventually, the functional loss characteristic of aged organisms. To determine whether these negative features of aging can be prevented by maintaining efficient autophagic activity until late in life, in this work we have corrected the CMA defect in aged rodents. We have generated a double transgenic mouse model in which the amount of the lysosomal receptor for CMA, previously shown to decrease in abundance with age, can be modulated. We have analyzed in this model the consequences of preventing the age-dependent decrease in receptor abundance in aged rodents at the cellular and organ levels. We show here that CMA activity is maintained until advanced ages if the decrease in the receptor abundance is prevented and that preservation of autophagic activity is associated with lower intracellular accumulation of damaged proteins, better ability to handle protein damage and improved organ function.

The purpose of this thread is to discuss potential possibilities for modifying model structures to the current existing LanceDB + LangChain RAG tasks based on our previous work.

## Shifting Towards Advanced RAG
Current paradigms can be adjusted towards the advanced RAG structure mentioned by [Gao et. al](https://paperswithcode.com/paper/retrieval-augmented-generation-for-large) with the potential pre-retrieval and post-retrieval process.

### Pre-retrieval Process
Potential retrieval strategies:
- Enhancing data granunarity
- Optimizing index structures
- Adding metadata
- Alignment optimization
- Mixed retrieval

Common methods:
- Query rewriting
- Query transformation
- Query expansion
- Other techniques

### Post-retrieval Process
Potential strategies:
- Selecting the essential information
- Emphasizing critical sections
- Shortening the context to be processed

Common methods:
- Rerank chunks
- Context processing

Frameworks:
- [LlamaIndex](https://www.llamaindex.ai/)
- [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/)
- [HayStack](https://haystack.deepset.ai/)

## Retrieval
### Retrieval Source
**Data Structure**: Our data is focusing on text for now.\
**Retrieval Granularity**: Coarse-grained retrieval units vs. Fine-grained retrieval units
- Token
- Phrase
- Sentense
- **Proposition**
- Chunks
- Document

### Indexing Optimization
1. **Chunking Strategy**: Chunk size
2. Metadata Attachments
3. Structural Index

### Query Optimization
1. Query Expansion
    1. Multi-Query
    2. Sub-Query
    3. Chain-of-Verification
2. Query Transformation
   1. Query rewrite
   2. Use prompt engineering to generate a query
  
## Embedding
- A sparse decoder (BM25)
- A dense retriever (BERT-based pre-trained LM)

Recent embedding models:
- AngIE
- Voyage
- BGE

## Alternative Retrieval Functions for Current RAG Structure 
Potential retrieval functions include both existing popular term-based methods like  BM25, TF-IDF, etc. and also potential self-defined new retrieval methods from others' previous work.
### LanceDB Vector Search and Retrieval Functions

- **Vector Search**: LanceDB supports vector search, which is crucial for applications requiring high-dimensional data analysis, such as recommendation systems, search engines, and AI applications that leverage embeddings.
- **Distance Metrics**: LanceDB offers a choice of distance metrics (L2, cosine, dot product) to measure the similarity between vectors. This flexibility allows users to select the metric that best aligns with their application's requirements.
- **Exhaustive and Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) Searches**: LanceDB provides options for both exhaustive searches (kNN without a vector index) and ANN searches (with a vector index), balancing between recall and latency based on the use case.

### LangChain Retrievers and Advanced Retrieval Types

- **General Retrieval Interface**: LangChain abstracts the concept of a retriever further than LanceDB, not restricting it to vector searches but also allowing for more generalized document retrieval based on unstructured queries.
- **Advanced Retrieval Methods**: LangChain introduces several innovative retrieval types (Vectorstore, ParentDocument, Multi-Vector, Self Query, etc.) that leverage both embeddings and metadata for more contextually relevant document retrieval.
- **Customizability and Integration**: LangChain stands out in its support for custom retriever implementations and integration with third-party retrieval services, offering a flexible framework for complex retrieval needs.

## Conclusion

Given LanceDB's current constraints on custom retrieval function support, LangChain presents a better opportunity to expand and customize retrieval functionalities. By leveraging LangChainâ€™s flexible retriever interface and advanced retrieval types, potentially we can implement sophisticated search and retrieval systems that surpass the capabilities of LanceDB alone.

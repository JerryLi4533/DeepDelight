The FIFA Women's World Ranking is a ranking system for women's national teams in association football (commonly known as football or soccer) published be the international governing body FIFA. As of August 2023, the Sweden national team is ranked #1.

The rankings were introduced in 2003,[2] with the first rankings published on 16 July of that year.[3][4] FIFA attempts to assess the strength of internationally active women's national teams at any given time based on their past game results with the most successful teams being ranked highest. As of January 2023, the ranking has 185 national teams.

The ranking has more than informative value, as it is often used to seed member associations into different pots in international tournaments.

Specifics of the ranking system
FIFA Women's World Rankings are based on every international match a team ever played, dating back to 1971, the first FIFA-recognized women's international between France and the Netherlands.
FIFA Women's World Rankings are implicitly weighted to emphasize recent results.
FIFA Women's World Rankings are only published four times a year. Normally, rankings are released in March, June, September and December. (In World Cup years, dates may be adjusted to reflect the World Cup results.)
The first two points result from the FIFA Women's World Rankings system being based on the Elo rating system adjusted for football; in 2018, FIFA modified the men's ranking system to similarly be based on Elo systems after continued criticism. FIFA considers the ratings for teams with fewer than 5 matches provisional and at the end of the list. In addition, any team that plays no matches for 4 years becomes unranked; this inactivity limit was previously 18 months, but was extended in early 2021 (after the COVID-19 pandemic stifled a significant amount of international play).

Leaders
As of the 25 August 2023 rankings release, Sweden is the number one ranked team. The United States holds the record for the longest consecutive period leading the rankings of nearly 7 years, from March 2008 to December 2014.
Before the 2023 World Cup, the United States and Germany had been the only two teams to lead the women's rankings, and these two teams also had held the top two spots in all but six releases, when Germany was ranked third (only Norway, Brazil, England and Sweden had reached second during this time).

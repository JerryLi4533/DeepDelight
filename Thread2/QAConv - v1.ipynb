I\\nhave never read a definitive account of that great moment in English naval\\nhistory.  Did Nelson fight in the Armada battle at Trafalgar? Is that the\\nbattle Jack Aubrey is always talking about?  Where the hell is Trafalgar?\\nI have the idea it is down there by Gibraltar but can't find it on the map.\\nOn the other hand, I have a vague fantasy of these little row boats coming\\nout at the mouth of the Thames to battle the mighty Armada.When one\\nconsiders  what the panic must have been like in the Spanish fleet when they\\nrealized that in spite of their size and assumed invincibility they were\\nactually vulnerable to that old maritime risk of sinking, one is\\ninvoluntarily  caused to cast one's badly  jaundiced commercial-legal  mind\\nupon  recent events of an analagous nature on board our own beloved ship,\\nsailing as it has been  in the northern  commercial straits.Has our\\nmighty Armada sailed out onto the seas of deregulation, only to meet the\\nperhaps I shall cease articulating  this line of thought and dwell\\nupon the ingenuity of the Engish.\\nAnyway,  I have come to a point here in Portland  where I need to go back\\ninto the policy context of our trading business.  I recall in Houston that\\nwe had these trading policies that you worked on and that they set limits and\\narticulated responsibilities.  Do you still have close contact with those\\npolicies and if so, is there a discrete document that pertains to the\\nPortland desk and if so would you be so kind as to send me a hard copy of\\nit?

The default choices are roast turkey breast with vegetables (without turkey if you are a vegan), and pasta with vegetable rataouille. Possible substitutions, baked Scrod (fish) chicken caesar salad hommus roll-up sandwich with salad salad with crab cakes churrasco flank steak with chimichurri (??) and onions I will do this in the following way, If you cannot eat one of these things please make that very clear. It will take at least two votes to change something, and will have to be compatible with what people can't do. The deadline is 3pm (boston time) Monday.

How about we have the following categories, + Things you need to do to meet the checkpoint (these can be fairly general) + Techniques to do this (which should say how much of it they do) + Things which are good to do although they go beyond the requirements of the checkpoint. + References These probably need to be sorted (where applicable) by tool type and priority. For example to meet checkpoint 1.1 in a level-A tool, all that needs to be done is to provide source editing (and meet checkpoint 1.2 Preserve all accessibiltiy information, which can be done by not messing up the source). But for a WYSIWYG tool this will not conform to 5.1 and 5.2, so the tool cannot get to double-A. A source editing tool can use this technique to any level. Cheers Charles\"}],\n",

This would be used by an author who is trying to repair accessibility problems in an existing PDF file. The best analogy is that it is doing OCR on the logical strucure. Like OCR technology, it is imperfect, and the results should be reviewed and corrected, if necessary, by the author. In Acrobat 5, this command was only available on Windows. In Acrobat 6, it is available for both Mac and Windows. When the Adobe Reader 6.0 is presenting an untagged PDF file to assistive technology, it automatically runs MakeAccessible internally to infer logical structure.

For any NOI (notice of inquiry), NPRM (notice of proposed rule making), etc. the government must follow the procedures established in the apa (i believe it is known as the Americans procedural Act) of 1947, which outlines the procedures of putting the NOI and NPRM out for comment for a specific time period. The problem is that when they do this and get a large response to a particular NPRM, they (the government) is obligated to read each and every one of the \\n responses, corrolate them and summarize them into specific response categories, if possible. They do this with a limited staff. This is not to say that i don't get frustrated either, but just an expalnation of the process. Jeffrey Pledger President, AbleTV.net\"}],\n",

       "    'text': 'Antonio Felix,\\n\\nAs Enron is finding several opportunities involving financial derivatives in\\nBrazil, we would like to get from Tozzini Freire Law Firm a summarized but\\nconcise read on the \"cans and cannots\" of these type of transactions in\\nBrazil. Here is my understanding of the regulations from the memo you have\\nalready sent to us regarding swaps and prepays as well as a list of the most\\ncommon examples of deals that Enron would be encountering in the marketplace.\\nI would appreciate if you could comment on what is written here and also add\\nfurther information so Enron can have some sort of menu of deals of this\\nnature that can be pursued. I would like to ask you to add your comment in\\nthis same message to make the review process a little easier. Thank you\\ninadvance for your attention.\\n\\nSwaps (Pulp & Paper, Petrochem, Power)\\n\\nOTC Swaps\\n\\nThe Central Bank regulates swap transactions involving local financial\\ninstitutions acting either as dealers for their own account or as\\nintermediaries to the contracting parties. When the financial institutions\\nact as intermediaries, the agreements are in fact private agreements\\nnegotiated by two non-financial companies, but become subject to the\\nrequirements and regulations normally applicable to swaps involving financial\\ninstitutions. According to regulations currently in force, such swaps can\\nrelate to exchange rates, interest rates, gold and price indices.\\n\\nAll of the swap agreements involving financial institutions must be\\nregistered with CETIP or with another custody and clearing system authorized\\nby the Central Bank or the CVM (Brazilian SEC). As a matter of practice, the\\nagreements used by the banks that participate in the swap market do not\\nfollow a standard form, since normally each bank has a particular sample form\\nwith which it feels more comfortable.\\n\\nDerivatives\\nIn addition to exchange-traded derivatives and OTC swaps involving financial\\ninstitutions, there is no legal impediment, in principle, to derivatives\\ntransactions being privately negotiated and entered into between two\\ninterested parties. As a general rule in Brazil, as long as no specific\\nprohibition is found in the law, parties are free to negotiate agreements\\nthat best suit their interests.\\n\\nInternational Hedge\\nCentral Bank regulations authorize that Brazilian companies enter into\\ntransactions abroad, either in exchanges or having a financial institution as\\ntheir counterpart, to hedge against the fluctuation of interest rates,\\nexchange rates or commodity prices in the international markets.\\n\\nSuch hedge transactions must refer to payments in foreign currency scheduled\\nto be made by or to the Brazilian company in respect of commercial or\\nfinancial rights or obligations, or to payments in local currency arising out\\nof certain financial obligations subject to the variation of exchange rates\\nand payments relating to imports, exports or local transactions involving\\ncommodities priced according to their valuation in foreign exchanges. The\\ncommercial market exchange rates are applicable to foreign exchange\\nagreements referring to remittances of currency in connection with hedge\\ntransactions.\\n\\nWhen the underlying obligation/right is registered with the Central Bank, the\\ncorresponding hedge transaction must be informed to the Central Bank within\\n10 days of its execution. When there is no registration with the Central\\nBank, the banks executing the foreign exchange agreements relating to the\\nhedge transaction must verify the existence of the obligation/right being\\nhedged.\\n\\nExamples\\n\\nCommodity swap between two Brazilian companies\\nAs per what has been said above, there is nothing that precludes Enron Brazil\\nof entering into a swap with another Brazilian company regarding any\\ncommodity traded by Enron (Pulp, Paper, Petrochem products, Power, Gas).\\nEnron does not need to be a financial institutions to provide swaps\\ntransactions. On the other hand, I am not sure yet on the following points\\n(1) Does such swap agreement should be registered with CETIP or any other\\nclearing system to be valid under Brazilian regulations? (2) What are the\\ntaxes involved in a swap?\\n\\nCommodity swap between a Brazilian company and an offshore company\\nThis kind of deal seems to be also available in the Brazilian market and the\\nonly difference from example 1 would be the fact that it must be registered\\nwith the Central Bank and it would involved transfer of foreign currency.\\n\\nCommodity swap between two offshore companies but involving Brazilian exports\\nI am not sure if Brazilian regulations would have anything to do with a\\ntransaction like this one. I would assume that a Brazilian exporter would\\nsell to their offshore subsidiary and such subsidiary would sell to their end\\ncustomer. Enron would step in and offer a swap agreement for the offshore\\nsubsidiary of the Brazilian company therefore Enron would not have any\\ninvolvement with Brazilian regulations because it would not be dealing with\\nBrazil.\\n\\n\\nPrepays (Pulp & Paper, Petrochem, Power)\\n\\nThe regulations currently in force governing export prepayments, especially\\nCentral Bank of Brazil\\'s Carta-Circular 2624, of February 14, 1996, establish\\nthat all repayments of principal under such transactions must necessarily be\\nmade by means of shipments of the relevant exported goods.  Carta-Circular\\n2624 allows cash remittances abroad only in regard to payments of interest\\nunder the facility.  Therefore, it is not possible to structure a transaction\\nwhere the repayment of principal will be made only in cash or where the\\nborrower has the ability to choose between paying cash or exporting the goods.\\n\\nA transaction that involves structuring a direct loan to the Brazilian\\ncompany where the value of the principal of which would be tied to the price\\nof the relevant commodity is very difficult to be approved.  Under a direct\\nloan registered with the Central Bank the borrower may remit all due amounts\\nof principal and interest in accordance with the schedule of payments\\nattached to the certificate of registration. The problem with such\\nalternative is that, although there are no express regulations preventing it\\nto do so, the Central Bank will most probably not issue a prior authorization\\nfor such type of loan, as it only normally issues authorizations for normal\\nloans where the principal is a fixed amount and the interest rate is either a\\nfixed rate or a floating rate (normally based on LIBOR or US Treasury).  It\\nshould also be noted that generally speaking all interest payments under such\\nan agreement are subject to withholding tax at the rate of 15% p.a.\\n\\nCC 5 Account\\n\\nA possible alternative way to structure a prepay would be by using a\\nnon-registered loan with the Central Bank.  Under such alternative, the funds\\ndisbursed by Enron under the loan would be remitted to Brazil through an\\ninternational transfer of Brazilian currency, as allowed by Circular 2677 of\\nthe Central Bank of Brazil. The international transfer of Brazilian currency\\n(\"International Transfer\") is a system which uses a non-resident current\\naccount in Brazil and the Brazilian interbank foreign exchange market to\\neffect remittances of funds to and from Brazil.  Under such system, a lender\\nthat wishes to disburse funds to a Brazilian borrower makes a foreign\\ncurrency deposit with a bank located outside of Brazil (\"offshore bank\")  and\\ninstructs the offshore bank to deliver such dollars to a Brazilian bank in\\nexchange for Brazilian currency.  Such Brazilian currency is then deposited\\nin a non-resident account held by the offshore bank in Brazil and thereafter\\ntransferred to the borrower. The repayments follow the inverse procedure,\\ni.e. the borrower deposits the amount in a non-resident account of an\\noffshore bank and instructs it to exchange the funds into foreign currency\\nand deliver them to the lender abroad.\\n\\nThe main differences between the registered loans and the non-registered\\nloans are that the non-registered loans are not subject to prior approval by\\nthe Central Bank of Brazil (and therefore not subject to scrutiny as to their\\nminimum tenors and applicable interest rates) and the applicable foreign\\nexchange rate to non-registered loans is the floating rate (as opposed to the\\ncommercial rate of exchange). All transfers of funds to Brazil as\\nInternational Transfers are subject to a Financial Transactions Tax (\"IOF\")\\nat the rate of 2% on the amount transferred, plus a bank fee that normally\\nranges from 0.4% to 0.6% of such amount.  Any interest payments under a\\nnon-registered loan are subject to withholding tax at the rate of 15% (or 25%\\nif the lender is located in a tax-haven jurisdiction).\\n\\nI don\\'t think this type of transaction is the best way to circumvent some of\\nthe Brazilian regulations regarding prepayment given the bad press that deals\\nvia the CC 5 Account mechanism would bring to Enron but I have it addressed\\njust in case someone does not share the same opinion.\\n\\nExamples\\n\\nFinancial prepay between two Brazilian companies\\nNot allowed unless the company providing the prepay qualifies as a financial\\ninstitution as per Brazilian law. Since it will not be the case in Enron\\'s\\ncases, we should not focus in these kind of transactions.\\n\\nFinancial prepay between a Brazilian company and an offshore company\\nAs it has been mentioned before it is allowed as long as Enron can structure\\nthe prepay in way where there is a pre-established amortization schedule for\\nprincipal and interest. It is very hard to structure a prepay with specific\\nsplit between principal and interest because the objective of the prepay is\\nto lock on a certain volume of a product and not on a specific price.\\nTherefore, if Enron prepays for a specific product on a floating basis the\\nattached value of that commodity can go up or down as the market fluctuates\\nas well as the total value associate to the deal. Such value can be either\\nprincipal or interest and it is impossible to determine what it will be.\\n\\nFinancial prepay between two offshore companies but one being a subsidiary of\\na Brazilian entity\\nI think there is no restrictions in this case given the whole deal will be\\nclosed offshore and the Brazilian authorities are not going to be involved.\\nIt will most likely be a deal involving three parties a company in Brazil,\\nits offshore subsidiary and Enron.\\n\\nPhysical prepay between two Brazilian companies\\nNo restrictions.\\n\\nPhysical prepay between a Brazilian company and an offshore company\\nNo restrictions as long as there is physical deliveries.\\n\\nPhysical prepay between two offshore companies but  involving Brazilian\\nexports\\nNo restrictions. It would also involve three parties a company in Brazil,\\nits offshore subsidiary and Enron.\\n\\nThanks,\\n\\nGustavo'}],\n",

If your browser uses the CSS2 cascade order, this will be fine. If not, then an author who has published a style sheet with !important will override yours.

The contracts were so unique that prior to 1988, the Interior Board of Contract Appeals, in a decision called the Busby case, had ruled that these contracts could not be enforced under the Contract Disputes Act precisely for the reason Justice Scalia articulated. Congress changed that. In 1988, Congress amended section 110 of the act, reproduced at the bottom of page 26a, and gave the Court of Claims, then the Court of Claims, and the district courts concurrent jurisdiction over money damages claims under the Contract Disputes Act.

And let me -- but I think this is significant, and if I can just walk the Court through the process by which the budget is developed and any appropriation ultimately is allocated. The Secretary has always, both before the ISDA and after the ISDA, taken the current year's allocation across programs as a given, as a baseline from which the next year's allocation will be built. And that's reflected in the terms of the statute on pages 14a to 15a of the appendix to the blue brief. There's a provision, 450j-1(b)(2), that says that the amount that's transferred to contractors shall not be reduced by the Secretary in subsequent years except pursuant to certain limited criteria and one of which, the principal one of which, is the reduction in appropriations. But we're not dealing with that in the relevant fiscal years. There was always an increase. And so the Secretary, pursuant to the statute, kept the funding for across programs at least at the level that it was at the previous fiscal year. Now, in addition to that, the Secretary builds two -- two considerations on top. The first is mandatory across-the-board increases for things such as salary COLA's and inflationary adjustments. And that's a standard feature of budgeting, and it's reflected again in the terms of the statute. And that -- I'd point the Court to page 9 of the Government's brief, the gray brief, where we cite a provision, 25 U.S.C. 1680a.\"}],\n",

The Veterans Administration had to reprogram. From where? We don't know, but the Veterans Administration had to reprogram and wanted to get approval from the Congress for that reprogramming action. Congress then stepped in but after the payment was due and forbade any reprogramming, and the Court then held when the payment was due, money was legally available and it doesn't matter where it comes from. There is no protection for inherent Federal functions. It may have come from some other hospital budget. It may have come from some other activity of the Veterans Administration. No doubt everything the VA does is important, but it doesn't mean it didn't have a legal obligation to pay the contract. There is no rule that has an IFF exception to the governmental duty to pay, and if there was, it would upset Government contract law deeply as the amicus brief from the National Chamber explains. Secondly, when funds are not available, we know what happens. This Court's decision, Justice Brandeis' decision for the Court, in Sutton explains what happens when funds are not available. There was a line item appropriation of $20,000 for a construction project. We understand that the contractor was on notice. Everything is square. Here, the entire lump sum appropriation was available, and I'd like to give the Court a sense of where the money could have come from, not that the Government had to do it. Just as in Blackhawk, if they chose not to reprogram, that's their right. But then there's a remedy. Where could the money have come from? In 1994, there was slightly under $2 million in a shortfall, just to the Cherokee contractor. No other contractor was apparently shorted. There was up to $98 million in leftover appropriations that year. There was 55 -- $88 million in an increase, up to $88 million in increase every year from $36 million to $88 million. There was $25 million in inherent Federal functions. They couldn't have shaved that by 10 percent to pay this contractor? Not that they had to. They could have taken some of it from there, some of it from the leftover, some of it from the increase, some of it from the offices at headquarters and area offices. That was their decision. But the contractor didn't take the risk that the Secretary would say, at the end of the day, I've decided to allocate 100 percent of my money this way, and by golly, there's nothing left for you. No contractor takes that risk in dealing with the Government, and surely, a tribal contractor with a mandatory contract set forth in the statute doesn't take that risk either. There is no limitation to the Secretary's theory in this case. The Secretary's theory means that we come, the contractors come, after the allocation of the Secretary. Well, the Secretary could, in a reduction year, decide to allocate the entire reduction to the contracts and enhance even his own Federal bureaucracy and programs serving other tribes and say, now I've made my decision and I've made my judgment. I don't have enough money to pay you. There's no limit here on contract support costs. It could be the secretarial amount. They could zero out these contracts and say it's practical availability. And we've decided there isn't enough money to deal with all of the health care needs in the country, so we're going to deal with the ones we operate and you come last. Now, that's not what the -- that's not what the statute permits. That sort of interpretation would lead to an absurdity. With regard to the Tenth Circuit decision, Justice, you asked a question about the declarations in the Tenth Circuit. There was a declaration in the Tenth Circuit, but all it had was a conclusory statement, to have reprogrammed anything would have caused reductions in programs serving other tribes. Now, that is not sufficient proof to withstand summary judgment, and it's certainly not sufficient proof to establish summary judgment. So for all these reasons, we believe the Tenth Circuit decision should be reversed and the Federal Circuit decision affirmed. Unless the Court has more questions.\"}],\n",

So we do think this is a statute-by-statute analysis and that you just can't adopt an automatic principle that because there's an anti-discrimination provision, it automatically always picks up retaliation protection. You have to look at it on a statute-by-statute basis. And here, though, all the relevant considerations, including Sullivan, including the need for this kind of protection to further the purposes of the statute, including the agencies' interpretation of this statute which, by the way, does provide fair notice that this was prohibited, included in -- I think I wanted to get back to Justice Kennedy's question about the Spending Clause. What the Spending Clause does not require is that it specifically refer to retaliation any more than it required that it specifically refer to peer-on-peer harassment. What it does require, though, is fair notice, and that fair notice is supplied by the Sullivan decision, this Court's cases saying that Sullivan is an important backdrop principle against which title IX was enacted, and finally the regulations themselves, which specifically forbid retaliation.\"}],\n",

Mallesons have suggested some minor attachments. These are in the\\nannexes to the advice. Following are my comments\\nPassword Agreement  - Fine, seems a good to give address for notices etc.\\nETA - I asked Mallesons to consider the wording of the indemnity clause under\\nAustralian law. The major concern is that in Australia special damages has a\\nnear opposite meaning to the US. The suggested amendment to clause 3(c) I\\nbelieve we could dispense with. It relates to a concern that an Enron\\nacceptance may be accessible on the Website Server. However, from what I have\\nbeen told this is not a foreseeable eventuality.\\nGTCs - Minor changes. The only one we are unlikely to incorporate relates to\\nthe  collateral clause. Obviously we are in a position to have different GTCs\\nfor different counterparties\\nAs a next step Paul I will give you copies of the Password Agreement and the\\nETA for inclusion in Road Show.

       "    'text': 'David,\\nThanks for your email. I noted a few points which I hope may be helpful\\n- re your comment \"Obviously we are in a position to have different GTCs\\nfor different counterparties\" - Please note that we are able to carry up to\\ntwo versions of the GTC Online - One with the collateral clause and one\\nwithout - and the assignment of GTC has been done by the credit dept. based\\non creditworthiness of the customer. Of course, this does not impact our\\nability to enter into separate Master Agreements or side letters which amend\\nthe terms of the GTC for specific customers - we just can\\'t carry copies of\\nthis amendment electronically on EnronOnline.\\n- Will you look after registering EnronOnline as a business name?\\n- I have asked Paul Goddard to check regarding the trademarking activities\\nand internet domain registration undertaken so far for EnronOnline in\\nAustralia.\\n- Can you provide some details as to the criteria required in assessing the\\n\"Exempt Futures Market Declaration\"? Does this apply to ourselves as well as\\nour customers? Will we need to incorporate this into our review of Australian\\ncustomers and/or any customers outside of Australia who wish to trade\\nAustralian power (if any)?\\n- Please note that the new EnronOnline home page screen states \"EnronOnline\\nprices are firm\". I assume this does not cause any problems for Austrlian law\\nregarding the legal definition of \"Invitation to Treat\", \"Offer\" and\\n\"Acceptance\"? Please note also the related information on the \"Click for\\nDetails\" link on the homepage.\\n- The comments in the Mallesons document regarding 3. \"Enron Responds to the\\nOffer\" are not strictly correct. The customer is essentially only able to\\nselect a volume equal to or less than that shown on EnronOnline and can only\\nsubmit a price which is shown on EnronOnline (please call me for a more\\ndetailed discussion of the price range function if needed). Enron can only\\nreject such Offers if the customers\\' credit limit is insufficient, or if the\\nprice or volume is no longer on the system at the instant in which the\\ncustomers\\' offer hits our database. The acceptance/rejection of a customer\\'s\\noffer at our database is entirely automatic and nearly instantaneous.\\n- 5. \"Confirmation Exchanged\" - although we currently issue faxed\\nconfirmations, please note that under EnronOnline, we are not under\\nobligation to do so - the electronic confirmation is deemed sufficient.\\n- Does the first PA amendment read correctly? (also the first ETA amendment)\\n- GTC amendment Do we need to reference \"ISDA\"? Is it not possible at some\\ntime now or in the future, to have a non-ISDA master?\\nDave'}],\n",

I noted a few points which I hope may be helpful\\n- re your comment \"Obviously we are in a position to have different GTCs\\nfor different counterparties\" - Please note that we are able to carry up to\\ntwo versions of the GTC Online - One with the collateral clause and one\\nwithout - and the assignment of GTC has been done by the credit dept. based\\non creditworthiness of the customer. Of course, this does not impact our\\nability to enter into separate Master Agreements or side letters which amend\\nthe terms of the GTC for specific customers - we just can\\'t carry copies of\\nthis amendment electronically on EnronOnline.\\n- Will you look after registering EnronOnline as a business name?\\n- I have asked Paul Goddard to check regarding the trademarking activities\\nand internet domain registration undertaken so far for EnronOnline in\\nAustralia.\\n- Can you provide some details as to the criteria required in assessing the\\n\"Exempt Futures Market Declaration\"? Does this apply to ourselves as well as\\nour customers? Will we need to incorporate this into our review of Australian\\ncustomers and/or any customers outside of Australia who wish to trade\\nAustralian power (if any)?\\n- Please note that the new EnronOnline home page screen states \"EnronOnline\\nprices are firm\". I assume this does not cause any problems for Austrlian law\\nregarding the legal definition of \"Invitation to Treat\", \"Offer\" and\\n\"Acceptance\"? Please note also the related information on the \"Click for\\nDetails\" link on the homepage.\\n- The comments in the Mallesons document regarding 3. \"Enron Responds to the\\nOffer\" are not strictly correct. The customer is essentially only able to\\nselect a volume equal to or less than that shown on EnronOnline and can only\\nsubmit a price which is shown on EnronOnline (please call me for a more\\ndetailed discussion of the price range function if needed). Enron can only\\nreject such Offers if the customers\\' credit limit is insufficient, or if the\\nprice or volume is no longer on the system at the instant in which the\\ncustomers\\' offer hits our database. The acceptance/rejection of a customer\\'s\\noffer at our database is entirely automatic and nearly instantaneous.\\n- 5. \"Confirmation Exchanged\" - although we currently issue faxed\\nconfirmations, please note that under EnronOnline, we are not under\\nobligation to do so - the electronic confirmation is deemed sufficient.\\n- Does the first PA amendment read correctly? (also the first ETA amendment)\\n- GTC amendment Do we need to reference \"ISDA\"? Is it not possible at some\\ntime now or in the future, to have a non-ISDA master?\\nDave'}],\n",

       "    'text': 'Attached is a draft advice from Mallesons on EnronOnline. Of immediate\\nconcern to us are the form of the various agreements for the road show next\\nweek. Mallesons have suggested some minor attachments. These are in the\\nannexes to the advice. Following are my comments\\nPassword Agreement  - Fine, seems a good to give address for notices etc.\\nETA - I asked Mallesons to consider the wording of the indemnity clause under\\nAustralian law. The major concern is that in Australia special damages has a\\nnear opposite meaning to the US. The suggested amendment to clause 3(c) I\\nbelieve we could dispense with. It relates to a concern that an Enron\\nacceptance may be accessible on the Website Server. However, from what I have\\nbeen told this is not a foreseeable eventuality.\\nGTCs - Minor changes. The only one we are unlikely to incorporate relates to\\nthe  collateral clause. Obviously we are in a position to have different GTCs\\nfor different counterparties\\nAs a next step Paul I will give you copies of the Password Agreement and the\\nETA for inclusion in Road Show. I expect to settle the advice early week  and\\nwill circulate it.'},\n",

When `raco pkg` runs `setup`, it provides the collections of the package being updated. As Matthew notes, this can end up being a lot of extraneous things if other packages provide modules in the same collection as the package being updated, or if they provide modules in the same collections as a package’s dependents.'}],\n",

For instance, some people fall in love with macros or types. What are some of the things you've found from all these different languages, that, if you had to pick—maybe wave a magic wand ... what true language if you could get some of these features out in addition to the immutability and, at least, _thinking_ in types?\\n\\n&gt; *Answer,* Well, it's definitely not static types. But macros or syntactic abstraction is something that I think makes sense across the entire spectrum of functional languages. Few people understand it. A lot of the pioneering work in syntactic abstraction has been done in the context of the Scheme and Racket language. They introduce things like, you could write macros [originating in Lisp] in the language you're also writing your programs in. The Scheme language has the idea of hygiene, and then there's a couple of things Racket refines. Macros are great for teaching and for doing things systematically. *The mechanisms to make that happen are very poorly understood outside of the Scheme and Racket community. For example, the Haskell people have a bunch of hacks to solve the same kind of problems that Racket and Scheme solve with a very small number of very powerful mechanisms.* —_Functional Geekery Episode 112 – Micheal Sperber_\"}],\n",

Images can further restrict this if they want by creating users and user groups and defining what user/group the container runs as when it first starts up.\\n- Containers running on the same host share the operating system kernel (unlike VMs where each gets its own hypervisor) but syscalls and the like can be intercepted and restricted\\n- All processes inside a container run in a single process group and the host may kill them all and restrict their resources arbitrarily\\n- Images do clever things to make having lots of them cheap in terms of storage space, and containers are _very cheap_ to start and run (unlike VMs)\"}],\n",

       "    'text': '<@Latarsha> Gotcha. So I think the part that\\'s confusing here is how a dockerfile gets turned into an image, and how an image describes the filesystem of containers run from it. An image has a list of _layers_, starting with the \"base layer\" which is empty(-ish), and each layer describes a filesystem diff from the previous layer. So images are like git repos, and if you take a base image (like `ubuntu`) and make ten different images that add 10MB of different stuff on top of it, you can cache all the layers in the `ubuntu` image when downloading those ten images.\\n\\nDockerfiles describe how to build images. *Each RUN, ADD, and COPY command makes a new layer*. So if you add a file in one RUN command, then remove it in the next, you don\\'t actually save any space in the image. In fact, you _double_ the space taken up by the thing you wanted to remove, because now the image has to store it twice, once in a diff that adds it, and once in a diff that removes it.'}],\n",

IIUC it means it adds `(* 0.5 alignment-scale)` to the coordinates when drawing a stroke iff `(quotient pen-width alignment-scale)` is an odd number, which at first sounds reasonable, it avoids a line being drawn on a “pixel boundary” when the pen width is odd. The problem is that this doesn’t really do the right thing for the `'aligned` smoothing mode, since it adjusts `x` _and_ `y`, which means that when the line is perfectly horizontal, it can cause the `x` coordinate to go out of alignment, and vice-versa for the `y` coordinate when the line is vertical. For lines that are neither perfectly horizontal nor perfectly vertical, it seems like neither adjustment is really right.\"}],\n",

The plant,s past operating problems and continued\\nstructural problems add some risk to the\\ncompany,s already weak financial profile. Most importantly, customers in\\nthe generally low-income service\\nterritory fought against rate increases needed to recover the nuclear\\ninvestment, helping to put El Paso Electric\\nin bankruptcy. A settlement signed with Texas customers in 1995 allowed\\nthe company to keep a $25 million\\nrate increase implemented in 1994, permitted accelerated depreciation of\\ngeneration and transmission assets,\\nand froze rates until 2005 in exchange for extending the El Paso Electric\\nfranchise.\\n\\nIn 1998, the company agreed to reduce rates--mainly residential--in New\\nMexico and Texas, bringing them\\nmore in line with Southwestern averages. By the time retail competition\\ncomes to either state (2002), El Paso\\nElectric will have a fairly competitive cost structure which should allow\\nthem to retain retail customers. By that\\ntime, El Paso Electric will have separated its assets into a regulated\\ntransmission and distribution business\\nand an unregulated electricity generation business, as required by New\\nMexico and Texas law. Costs incurred\\nto effect this change will be recovered in a competitive transition\\ncharge. Stranded costs (accrued charges\\nrelated to generating plant costs which would have been recovered in a\\nregulated market) will be recovered over\\na five-year transition period in New Mexico. In Texas, the rate\\nsettlement allowed El Paso to recover those costs\\nthrough accelerated depreciation over the 10-year period of the\\nsettlement agreement.\\n\\nIn the wholesale market, El Paso successfully renegotiated contracts with\\nthe Comision Federal de\\nElectricidad, the national utility of Mexico, to supply peaking capacity\\nin the summer months of 2000 and 2001,\\nand with the Rio Grande Electric Cooperative Inc. to supply power to two\\nTexas cities over a four-year period.\\nImportantly, El Paso Electric also reached a settlement with the city of\\nLas Cruces, N.M., ending a long dispute\\nover that city,s threat to municipalize the electric distribution system.\\nLas Cruces sales account for about 8% of\\ntotal revenue.\"}],\n",

Gray Davis and state policymakers for allowing the\\nstate\\'s power crisis to finally succumb to rolling blackouts.\\n\\n\\nState officials ignored the commission\\'s Dec. 15 market-restructuring order\\nand instead embraced \"conspiracy theories, resistance to more realistic\\nrates, and calls for palliative price capsto obscure the issues and delay\\nsolutions,\" Hoecker said.\\n\\n\\nWhite House-brokered negotiations to develop power-supply contracts as part\\nof a near-term solution are at an impasse due to \"unrealistic\" demands by\\nGov. Davis that power providers agree to contracts at rates below their cost\\nof production, Hoecker said.\\n\\n\\nHe further called for Davis and lawmakers to relent in their unrealistic\\nposition that retail rates continue to be frozen at below-present-cost,\\npre-1996 levels.\\n\\n\\nUnless state officials agree to pursue realistic policies, Edison\\nInternational\\'s Southern California Edison Co. (EIX) and PG&E Corp.\\'s Pacific\\nGas & Electric Co. (PCG), will be pushed into bankruptcy by following the\\nstate\\'s flawed market-restructuring law, Hoecker said.\\n\\n\\n\"Perhaps bankruptcy can be averted. If it cannot, perhaps it will force\\ndebtors, creditors and state officials to address the financial problems of\\nutilities in a new light, without recrimination and posturing,\" he said.\\n\\n\\n\"Let\\'s be realistic,\" Hoecker said. \"Wall Street and consumers share one\\ncritical trait Without a reasonable, technically defensible and\\ncomprehensive set of solutions to such crises, they have no basis for\\nconfidence that problems can or will be managed or confidence to support\\ninvestment on one hand and political forbearance on the other.\"\\n\\n\\nHoecker called for state officials to \"expeditiously\" implement the\\nprovisions of FERC\\'s Dec. 15 order.\\n\\n\\nIn particular, he said, the California Power Exchange is making the financial\\nsituation worse by ignoring the order\\'s provision calling for suspension of\\nthe single-price auction when prices bid exceed $150 per megawatt-hour.\\n\\n\\n\"Prices above the level allowed in the Dec. 15 order (have) further\\njeopardized the financial status of California utilities,\" he said.\\n\\n\\nReaching a deal on forward contracts, as called for in FERC\\'s order, is\\nessential, Hoecker said. \"An arbitrary bottom-line solution cannot be\\nprescribed without regard to costs,\" he said.\\n\\n\\nBut Hoecker reserved perhaps his harshest criticism for the state\\'s first\\nlegislative response to the crisis, which Davis signed into law Thursday, to\\nreplace the California Independent System Operator\\'s industry-participant\\ngoverning board with a board of political state appointees.\\n\\n\\nSuch mixing of markets and politics on the ISO, a FERC-jurisdictional entity,\\nrepresents \"an unacceptable intrusioninto federally regulated power\\nmarkets,\" Hoecker said.\\n\\n\\nFurther, he said, FERC made \"mistakes\" in allowing AB 1890, the state\\'s\\nelectricity restructuring law, to usurp the commission\\'s regulatory authority\\nover wholesale power markets in the first place.\\n\\n\\n\"Because the state is now clearly a market participant, the independence of\\nthe (ISO) board is bound to be compromised. Consequently, the state\\'s\\ndecisions are no longer entitled to the kind of deference we have accorded it\\nsince AB 1890,\" Hoecker said.\\n\\n\\n\"More than that, this action evinces a bald disregard for federal\\njurisdiction and a rejection of cooperative solutions (called for in FERC\\'s\\nDec. 15 restructuring order),\" Hoecker said. \"I recommend that the commission\\nseek to enjoin this technically flawed and unlawful usurpation of its\\nauthority.\"\\n\\n\\nHoecker rejected the state\\'s continuing call for firm price caps in the\\nregion. \"Price caps will only jeopardize reliability, mask problems\\ntemporarily, and deter or destroy any chance to solve the long-term supply\\nchallenge,\" he said.\\n\\n\\nHoecker urged an urgent response by policymakers, regardless of whether the\\nutilities enter bankruptcy.\\n\\n\\n\"We cannotkeep moving from one failure to the next, with no agreed-upon\\nobjectives. The governor\\'s stated plans are unrealistic and ours\\' cannot be\\nfully implemented without his help,\" Hoecker concluded. \"I urge state\\npolicymakers to reject the false illusion that going it alone will serve the\\ninterests of California consumers.\"\\n\\n\\n-By Bryan Lee, Dow Jones Newswires; 202-862-6647; <email>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

The company has not made any\\nmove towards calculating cost of funds by commercial team.\\nThe Account Inquiry functionality in Unify was thought to be a key on-line\\ntool.\\tOld habits die hardmost users appear to be printing reports and reviewing\\ndata, rather than using the on-line functionality.\\nOverapplication of cash was not to be allowed.  Overpayments would be\\nclassified as \"on account\", with issues tracked in a case management system.\\tCase\\nmanagement system does not exist.  Allowing overapplication helps the account\\ncoordinators track overpayments easier than leaving cash on account.\\nThe counterparty/legal entity combination on the deposit needed to match the\\ncounterparty/legal entity combination on the Enron invoice.\\tGiven the number of legal\\nentities Enron has, along with the number of entities our counterparties\\nhave, this seems like a hopeless battle.  Allowing cross-application of cash\\nseems easier.\\nCorp required that intercompany settlements had to be \"settled\" with cash\\nmovement.\\tCorp no longer requires intercompany settlements to be \"settled\" with cash\\nmovement.\\n\\nConverting to SAP AR simplifies the Unify/SAP interface in the following ways\\nBank deposits into SAP do not have to be split off into Unify\\nCash entries in Unify do not have to be interfaced back to SAP\\nUnify netting entries do not have to be interfaced to SAP\\nPayables information does not have to be interfaced from SAP to Unify\\n\\nGiven the change in attitudes towards our netting business process we face\\ntwo problems in Unify.\\nControls built into Unify are already obsolete.\\nUnify does not maintain all products in one database, making efforts to net\\nacross products in the future (physical with financial, for instance)\\nimpossible.\\n\\nOur understanding of the netting process in SAP indicates that there are no\\ncontrols (which sounds good at this point) and that we would retain the\\nautomatic netting entries when the payable is netted with the receivable\\nwithin SAP.  However, we emphasize that netting would be done in SAP, not at\\nthe time of finaling a payment in Unify.\\n\\nTo repeat, we are recommending that Unify AR be turned off and we convert to\\nSAP AR.

The Bush campaign is analyzing God\\'s Word for possible\\ngrounds\\nfor appeal.\\n\\n\"God\\'s ruling is a classic over-reach,\" argued Bush campaign strategist\\nJim\\nBaker. \"Clearly, a divine intervention in a U.S. Presidential Election is\\nunprecedented, unjust, and goes against the constitution of the state of\\nFlorida.\"\\n\\n\"Jim Baker\\'s a jackass,\" God responded. \"He\\'s got some surprises ahead of\\nhim,\\nlet me tell you.

It seems to me that we both need to\\nfinalize the structure as well as co-ordinate across various groups such that\\nwe all know what each is doing with the view to funding on time by the end of\\nnext week.\\n\\n1. As soon as possible next week (i.e. Monday) we need to finalize the swap\\nstructure including the credit and covenant package.\\n\\n2. If there is not already a Term Sheet in place, it may be useful to have\\none prepared.  Frankly, it seems from my various discussions with Global\\nFinance, Credit, Origination, Enron Corp., Royal Bank of Canada and its\\nexternal counsel and our external counsel, that there are certain agreements,\\ndocuments, deliverables and covenants that are being expected by, or\\nexchanged between, the parties, but which are not being communicated among\\neach other and we are therefore working at cross purposes.  Frankly, unless\\nand until we know what the structure is to look like, what the credit and\\nfinancial covenants are to look like, and what the documentation expectations\\nare, it is difficult if not  impossible to prepare documentation.  For\\nexample\\n\\n(a) I had a confusing conversation with the Bank as to the form of Guarantee\\nthey were expecting from Enron Corp.  I was trying to require the Bank to\\naccept an Enron Corp. standard form Guarantee, whereas the Bank was looking\\nfor a long form Guarantee that includes the covenants, representations and\\nwarranties of Enron Corp. in its revolving credit facilities.  Based upon\\nthis disagreement, I left a message for Clement to the effect that we may\\nhave a problem to resolve.  However, Clement was kind enough to advise me by\\nvoice mail that in fact Enron Corp. does not have a problem with giving a\\nlong form Guarantee of this nature and that the form of Guarantee had in fact\\nbeen provided (by whom I\\'m not sure) to the Bank.\\n\\n(b) The Bank was enquiring as to what would be the governing law of the\\nEnron Corp. Guarantee, to which I advised it would be Texas law.  However, I\\nnow understand there may be some agreement (by whom I\\'m not sure) to have the\\nEnron Corp. Guarantee governed by New York law.\\n\\n(c) In any event, I understand that the Bank will be looking for a form of\\nenforceability opinion from Enron Corp.\\'s outside legal counsel with respect\\nto the authorization, execution, delivery and enforceability of the Enron\\nCorp. Guarantee, as well as certain conflicts of laws opinions with respect\\nto the governing law of the Guarantee (Texas/New York) being enforceable.\\n\\n(d) In my discussions with the Bank this afternoon, it also became aware to\\nme that the Bank is expecting external counsel legal opinions with respect to\\nEnron Canada.  Blake, Cassels & Graydon is prepared to provide those legal\\nopinions.\\n\\n(e) As noted above, I have discussed with the Bank that the governing law of\\nthe underlying swap documents would be Alberta, to which they seemed fine.  I\\nsuggested that Ontario law would also be acceptable.\\n\\n(f) I assume that Enron Canada ought to obtain legal opinions from the\\nBank\\'s external counsel with respect to the documents and obligations of\\nSwapco (and perhaps even the Bank), but I will need to have this confirmed.\\n\\n(g) It came to my attention during my conversations with the Bank this\\nafternoon that Swapco (or financing SPV) is unaffiliated to the Bank.  This\\npresents problems as, I understand for accounting purposes, the two swaps\\ninvolving Enron Canada cannot be linked, for example by cross-defaults.  At\\nthe same time unaffiliated exposures under de-linked transactions may not be\\ncapable of being set-off.  We undertook to attempt to remedy this situation\\nthrough broadening the set-off concepts under the ISDA Master Agreements.\\n\\n(h) I do not think the Bank frankly (nor anyone else) has a firm grasp on\\nthe credit/collateralization/margin requirements, which I think is dependent\\nupon a final understanding of the swap structure.\\n\\n(i) From my discussions with the Bank, it seemed to me that they were not\\nclear as to how their fees and costs would be repaid through the swap\\nstructure.  Although it might be as simple as adding these amounts to the\\nprincipal amount of the swaps, I suggested that the Bank prepare a separate\\n\"fee letter\" to recover its fees.  More problematically, the Bank was not\\nclear as to how \"increased costs\" would be accounted for in the swap\\nstructure.  Generally speaking, a Bank credit agreement contains provisions\\nthat if there are increased costs of funding to the Bank as a result of a\\nchange in Bank regulations or lending or reserve requirements, those\\nincreased costs are flowed through.  They were not sure how this could be\\naccommodated in a swap structure.  I suggested that there may be some way to\\nfix this through a price adjustment mechanism in the fixed price or volumes\\nor through a separate indemnification in the \"fee letter\".\\n\\n(j) The Bank is anxious to see paper, and I am not sure who is preparing the\\npaper and consolidating it in a distribution package to the Bank.  For\\nexample, I think a package that includes all of the swap Master Agreements\\nand related documentation (which I believe Mark T\\'s group will prepare in\\nHouston), the Enron Corp. Guarantee (which I\\'ve indicated above seems to have\\nalready been provided in draft to the Bank) and all other documentation needs\\nto be sent to the Bank as soon as possible, as well as to Blake, Cassels &\\nGraydon and Vinson and Elkins if they are to be giving legal opinions to the\\nBank in connection with the transaction.  Of course this depends on\\nfinalization of the structure as well as the credit and other covenants\\npackage.  In concept, I have told the Bank, and I believe the Bank agrees,\\nthat the form of the ISDA Master and related documentation would be the same\\nas the form of ISDA Master which currently exists between ENA and Royal Bank\\nof Canada, and the Bank asked that they at least be provided with that paper\\nas soon as possible.  Perhaps Tana could look after delivering that as soon\\nas possible, if not this afternoon, Monday morning.\\n\\nFrankly, I think this project, if it is to get funded on time, needs a\\nmeasure of co-ordination and communication of internal and external\\nexpectations.  It may be worthwhile to convene a conference call with all\\nrelevant groups (i.e. Legal/Global Finance/Credit/Origination) on Monday\\nmorning.\\n\\nRegards,\\nPeter'}],\n",

So I think there are people on Capitol Hill who are starting to really ponder, What is the structure of these organizations and what role do they play? What\\'s appropriate for them to do? And this is just sort of an interesting look at conflicts of interest. We are not, in any way - our story has not said that it is illegal, just that it raises questions about how it functions.Well, you did quote Alan Boyce in your story, a former bond trader who\\'s been involved in efforts to push for more refinancing of home loans. Freddie Mac, he said, prevented households from being able to take advantage of today\\'s mortgage rates and then bet on it. You say, well, Freddie Mac has two arms, one, the left hand, did not necessarily know what the right hand is doing. However, they seemed to be miraculously working in concert.And there are people in Congress now who are starting to wonder about whether or not this should be changed, at the moment, as the laws are structured, and as Freddie Mac\\'s mission is, which is to not go broke. You know, it\\'s supposed to be a solvent organization doing its business, but it\\'s also supposed to be helping homeowners. This structure could be called into question.'"

Under the Ninth Circuit's decision, public employees engaged in such work have at least a presumptive first amendment right to perform their jobs as they see fit. That conclusion rests on a fundamentally mistaken view of the first amendment. When the Government pays for somebody to do its work, it has an absolute right to control and direct the manner in which that work is performed. That is a basic rule of agency law, and insofar as Federal employees are concerned, it's a basic rule of our constitutional structure. Article II of the Constitution gives the President the power and responsibility to take care that the laws be faithfully executed. Effectuation of that power, and effectuation of the principle of accountability that it embodies, requires that supervisors in the executive branch be able to control and direct the work of their subordinates. The first amendment, which was adopted just a few years after the Constitution, was not meant to interpose the first amendment in that relationship between supervisor and subordinate or otherwise to regulate the internal affairs of the executive branch. That is the function of civil service laws adopted by the legislature and internal executive branch directives taking into account the relative costs and benefits of certain types of regulation.

It's the most important center of learning of Sunni Islam. And he and the pope have met several times, and they've established a very good relationship.OK. So it's an opportunity for the pope to reach out to Muslims but also speak directly to those 1 million Catholics we just mentioned.Absolutely. Tomorrow he is going to celebrate a mass in a large stadium. There are about 135,000 people who are expected, and some people here are already describing it as the biggest public display of Christian worship in the Islamic heartland because, although the UAE prides itself to be a haven of tolerance, Islam is the official religion, and freedom of worship in other religions have many - there's a lot of restrictions.Francis may challenge his host to grant full religious freedom and also better protection for noncitizens. This is a country that's also been sharply criticized for its human rights record. Keep in mind that out of a population of 9 million, only 1 million are Emiratis. The rest are all foreigners working in this oil-rich federation.Well, let me raise another awkward issue if I can, Sylvia.

The produced s-expression is then treated the same way as a program you wrote yourself.But after the reader finishes, then the macroexpander gets to transform the program, and it enforces hygiene.I think this is, in some respects, a flaw in the way Racket’s language stack works. But it basically means you want to do as much in the expander as you can, and as little in the reader.okay this all makes sense againit's hard to come back to thinking about this after time away!It seems the reason of scrolling problems is that the os deliver wheel events much more quick than DrRacket's redrawing.

What the Federal Circuit is talking about now is an inquiry into motivation, not skill. Those two are very different concepts. There is not a word in this Court\\'s precedents that says that whether a patent should be granted or not depends on whether a hypothetical person had hypothetical motivation to do what everybody knows he could do.Of course, the reason that the Federal Circuit has devised this additional test or gloss on Graham is that they say obviousness is, it\\'s deceptive in hindsight. In hindsight everybody says, I could have thought of that; and that you need -- if you don\\'t have the sort of constraint that their test imposes, it\\'s going to be too easy to say that everything was obvious.Well, the Court, Mr. Chief Justice, the Court needs to be very clear what is meant by the term \"hindsight.\" If by hindsight is meant looking at what\\'s claimed now, the subject matter sought to be patented, and comparing that to the prior art, to call that analytical process improper hindsight is to make a frontal assault on the statute itself. If by hindsight means to posit a desired result, a clay doorknob, and to ask whether more skill and ingenuity than were required by ordinary skill in the art was needed to do that, to say that that constitutes improper hindsight is to make a frontal assault on the entire body of this Court\\'s precedents construing section 103 and its common law predecessors. With regard to the kind of bias Your Honor is talking about, this Court\\'s precedents provide a wealth of mechanisms for protecting against that, including the statement towards the end of the Graham opinion, which is the only source of the word \"hindsight\" that I\\'ve seen cited in the amici brief, which was a discussion of the secondary consideration. So that in a case like Goodyear against Rayovac there\\'s an excellent case where the claimed subject matter seems so simple in hindsight. This was a case decided by this Court in 1944. A leakproof battery that had been a problem that had defied solution for years and there was all kinds of motivation to solve it, and the fact that it was not solved was considered important by this Court in sustaining the validity of the patent in that case, which claimed nothing more than a sheet metal sheath wrapped around the electrodes and materials generated in the battery.'},\n",

But it could be that she is quoting, as you'll see in the transcript, California law that had talked about jury balances. It's good to have young and old. It's good to have different races. I agree. You're absolutely right. J.E.B. v. Alabama had occurred a couple of years before, and the judge does say, I don't see, Ms. Satriano, that you are seeking to justify excusing people of one ethnicity based on gender. So he seemed to at least be saying, you started with youth. Everything you said about youth, ties in the community, tolerance for drug use, unmarried, which might be distinctions with other young people -- those -- do you have anything else to say? And I -- I suspect she felt like compelled to come up with some further explanation.What -- what is the -- where -- where is the place in what the judge -- when did this eye-rolling take place? I can't figure it out.Okay. Yes. During the judicial voir dire.Yes, I have that in front of me.And --What was the statement that the judge made in respect to which the juror is supposed to have rolled her eyes?The district attorney simply says with one of the questions to which you -- the prospective --Which question?It's unclear.So the reason I can't find it out is none of us know.No, you're right. I mean, it's one where -- it doesn't say in the record eye-rolling.And it actually says it wasn't a question. It was a statement, and that's why I can't figure it out.It -- it seems to be where the juror said yes in response to the voir dire, and then --Which was a question you said ---- turned aside. All we know is yes was said. We don't know what the question was.I see.The -- a point I guess to be made about this confusing transcript -- and of course, I don't know what the file looked like with respect to Miller-El, but this is it. Obviously, there's not a lot to go on, and I think it suggests how vital it is to rely on the trial court judge to make some credibility determination. He's there and sees the district attorney and tries to, after making appropriate inquiries, say that he accepts her non-racial reasons. Counsel for respondent does a lot to compare to Miller-El and so perhaps it's worth just distinguishing briefly. There we have 10 of 11 African American jurors struck. We have the lawyers doing the questioning, trick questions, loaded questions, complicated questions. We have the external evidence of the Dallas manual recommending discriminatory strikes. We have the cards with race written on them. Here, we have a very brief, quick proceeding. The judge is asking the questions and really resisting lawyers' attempts to add to that, to get more information so you can make a valid assessment of the juror that's before you. And so in this instance, obviously, relying on intuition, trial experience, she exercises the two peremptory challenges, one of which was withdrawn on appeal and not pursued, the other with respect to the young person, the demeanor, and youthfulness are the grounds given.\"},\n",

I mean, you can promote entrepreneurship by making it more profitable, but you can also promote entrepreneurship by making it less insecure.Global observers argue that one of the benefits of Sweden's unpaid leave system is that it recognizes it's more than just financial risk that puts off entrepreneurs. Career risk is also a key factor in whether or not people take the plunge in launching a business.Regardless what you do after you fail as entrepreneur, when you go back to the labor market, you might have a hard time finding a job as good as the old one.That's Ting Xu, an assistant professor at the University of Virginia whose work focuses on entrepreneurial finance.\"},\n",

       "  'text': 'That\\'s correct, Justice Scalia. I think the confusion is the use of the term \"aggravated murder,\" which would be not quite correct under Kansas law. There is a statutory requirement of a finding of guilt of capital murder, and that is in very narrow circumstances. Kansas has one of the most narrow death penalties in the Nation. Then once that guilt is determined, we then move to the phase where the State must prove an aggravating factor in addition to having proved that the defendant is guilty of capital murder. Once that is achieved, then the jurors are instructed to give way to a consideration to all aggravating factors that they find, with unanimity, to exist, and to consider all mitigating evidence which they find, individually, to exist, with the only burden on the defendant being relevancy for introduction. And then, they are instructed to consider whether the State has proven, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the mitigating factors do not outweigh the aggravating factors. And, Mr. Chief Justice, if it may please the Court, I\\'d like to reserve the remainder of my time.Thank you, General Kline. Ms. Woodman.Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, Since the argument of the attorney general was addressed exclusively to the question of the constitutionality of the Kansas statute, I will devote all of my argument to that subject, as well, although I am sure that the Court, in deliberations, will be considering the several jurisdictional issues which were briefed and argued earlier in the term. And if there are no questions on those jurisdictional issues, I will proceed to the merits. To pick up on some of the things that were said during Attorney General Kline\\'s argument, the Eighth Amendment requires reliability in the determination that death is an appropriate sentence. And at the selection stage, the question is whether the jury has made a reliable, collective, responsible decision based upon the unique circumstances of the individual defendant that death is an appropriate sentence and that this defendant is particularly culpable in a way that distinguishes him from the mass of death-eligible defendants. And the problem with the equipoise provision here, which the State agrees can occur under the Kansas statute, is that we don\\'t know from a death verdict pronounced by a jury in Kansas whether the jury did decree death by equipoise or not. Death sentences must be rationally reviewable.

The nodeclass determines what those attributes are when the node is first created. If one of those attributes is `\\'tag?` and its value is `#t`, then the node is a tag.

So they may just have to straight up beg for an exemption from the office that handles sanctions in the Treasury Department. It's called the Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC. But Ferrari says as much as Norwegian might want to call OFAC and say come on, we're losing money here...I mean, it's inherent in sanctioning that somebody is going to lose money.It's kind of the point.Right.Instead, he recommends that Norwegian Air put their plea in terms of foreign policy or national security interests, something a little more like, dear OFAC, if you don't grant us this exemption, this plane will stay in Iran. And if that happens...You don't have any control over what might happen to that plane if it will get confiscated or seized by the government.Which would mean that Iran would get a brand-new fancy plane, which the sanctions were created in part specifically to prevent. Obviously, the point of sanctions is not to disincentivize pilots from making safe emergency landings or to keep a $100 million airplane stuck on a tarmac. But that's the thing about these sanctions. They cast a very wide net. They don't just punish Iran. They're meant to cut off Iran from the rest of the world, which they do in part by penalizing anyone from anywhere who tries to do business with Iran.And that is how the United States got in the middle of Norwegian Air's business and Dario's vacation. Dario and his fellow passengers did get out. About a day later, a new plane flew into Shiraz just to get them. But as we sit here today, Norwegian Air's plane is still in Iran.

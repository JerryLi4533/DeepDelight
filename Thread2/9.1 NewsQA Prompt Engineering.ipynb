    "# NewsQA Prompt Engineering\n",
    "12/7/2023\n",
    "\n",
    "Lixiao Yang\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is updated based on [`8.1 NewsQA Loop with HuggingFace.ipynb`](https://github.com/lixiao-yang/DeepDelight/blob/main/Thread2/8.1%20NewsQA%20Loop%20with%20HuggingFace.ipynb), for loop running for large dataset, refer to the `NewsQA Loop - v2.ipunb`. This notebook adds new explorations in prompt engineering for HuggingFace `InstructEmbedding` (`sentence-transformers/multi-qa-MiniLM-L6-cos-v1`) and locally deployed GPT4ALL `gpt4all-falcon-q4_0` model for semantic search and local data training, this notebook also included the retrieval texts from the model aims at differentiating the previous work is caused by **retrival problem** or **instruction problem**. Three additional prompt methods are examined to compare the effect of prompt engineering in question answering. The output is only demonstrating the first story's results.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Updates\n",
    "1. Add the retrival content from the model to identify whether the model find the 'correct' sentence for answering question.\n",
    "2. Add three additional prompt methods in the query instructions: \n",
    "   1. **Prompt Focusing on Detailed Analysis**: When you embed each sentence, focus closely on the details and the overall context of the news story. Pay attention to who is involved, what exactly happened, the timing of the events, and where they took place. Also, consider why these events are significant. This detailed analysis will help you accurately answer questions that require a deep understanding of the news story.\n",
    "   2. **Prompt Highlighting Key Elements**: As you process the sentences, concentrate on the main events and the participants in the story. Make sure to identify the key players (who), the actions or events described (what), the timeline of these events (when), the locations involved (where), and the reasons or motives behind them (why). This focus will enable you to provide precise answers to questions that center around these crucial elements of the news.\n",
    "   3. **Prompt Emphasizing Narrative Structure**: Your task is to capture the narrative flow of the news story, with an emphasis on the sequence of events and causality. Examine the connections between the participants (who), the series of events (what), their chronological order (when), the settings (where), and the motivations behind them (why). This approach will assist you in answering questions that depend on understanding how the story unfolds and the cause-and-effect relationships within it.\n",
    "3. Import a potential F1 score calculation method (similar to original one).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Findings\n",
    "1. No obvious relationship between different prompt and HuggingFace Model only, might be caused by the model only select the sentence with highest score, which for same corpus, the sentence of the highest cosine similarity should be consistent.\n",
    "2. Different answers are answered for different prompt using GPT4ALL model.\n",
    "3. Potential models to use: [FLAN-T5](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/flan-t5) (no obvious improvements observed), [BERT](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/bert) (needs training to finetuning), [ELECTRA](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/electra) (needs training to finetuning)\n",
    "4. Future model framework: encoder-decoder / decoder-only models\n",
    "5. Current results more lean towards **prompt problem**."

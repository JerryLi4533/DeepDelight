# Broad Twitter Corpus
Introduced by Derczynski et al. in Broad Twitter Corpus: A Diverse Named Entity Recognition Resource : https://paperswithcode.com/paper/broad-twitter-corpus-a-diverse-named-entity

This paper introduces the Broad Twitter Corpus (BTC), which is not only significantly bigger, but sampled across different regions, temporal periods, and types of Twitter users. The gold-standard named entity annotations are made by a combination of NLP experts and crowd workers, which enables us to harness crowd recall while maintaining high quality. We also measure the entity drift observed in our dataset (i.e. how entity representation varies over time), and compare to newswire.

## Dataset Summary

This is the Broad Twitter corpus, a dataset of tweets collected over stratified times, places and social uses. The goal is to represent a broad range of activities, giving a dataset more representative of the language used in this hardest of social media formats to process. Further, the BTC is annotated for named entities.

See the paper, Broad Twitter Corpus: A Diverse Named Entity Recognition Resource, for details.

The most varied parts of the BTC are sections F and H. However, each of the remaining four sections has some specific readily-identifiable bias. So, we propose that one uses half of section H for evaluation and leaves the other half in the training data. Section H should be partitioned in the order of the JSON-format lines. Note that the CoNLL-format data is readily reconstructible from the JSON format, which is the authoritative data format from which others are derived.

### Test: Section F

### Development: Section H (the paper says "second half of Section H" but ordinality could be ambiguous, so it all goes in. Bonne chance)
